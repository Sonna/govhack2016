    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Warrnambool Orderly Room, on Kepler and Timor Streets, was constructed in 1868 on the Warrnambool Government Reserve and expanded to include a Gun Room and Residence in the late 1880s. The masonry Orderly Room was designed by the Shire Engineer A. Kerr and was regarded to be one of the most elegant of the volunteer defence association buildings in Victoria. </P>\r\n<P>A sense of isolation and the vulnerability of Victoria's gold wealth precipitated the development of the volunteer movement in the colony, and in 1854, the Volunteer Act was passed. In Warrnambool there were attempts to form a volunteer unit as early as 1855; however it appears these were unsuccessful.</P>\r\n<P>The Orderly Room on Kepler Street was built and used by the Warrnambool Detachment of the Western Corps Royal Victorian Volunteer Artillery. After the 1858 Amending Act, the Warrnambool Volunteer Rifle Corps was established in 1859, disbanded in 1863, before the new Warrnambool Detachment was formed in September 1866. Before a permanent building was provided, the Volunteer corps met and trained in the Royal Exchange Hotel. A public appeal was made in 1867 and in 1868 a site was reserved for an Orderly Room on the Kepler Street edge of the government reserve. The building designed by council engineer, Andrew Kerr and was opened with a grand ball on New Year's Eve 1868, with the celebrations were deemed so successful that another ball was staged the following evening. The then Governor of Victoria, Sir Henry Manners Sutton, claimed it to be the finest Orderly Room he had seen in the Colony. In early 1869, the Orderly Room grounds and land adjacent to it were permanently reserved for the militia by the Government. </P>\r\n<P>In 1884, new legislation was passed which abandoned the volunteer system in favour of a partly paid Militia Force to supplement the Colony's small permanent defence force. The Warrnambool facilities were retained for use by the new militia. The addition of the Gun Room and the adjacent cottage to the Orderly Room in September 1888, were part of the Public Works Department major upgrade of orderly room facilities, headed by S.E. Bindley.</P>\r\n<P>During boththe First and Second World Wars,the Orderly Room was used as the headquarters of the local military authorise to enlist volunteers and for medical examinations. The Warrnambool Orderly Room was used for military training until after the Second World War, and later used as an assembly hall and venue for concerts held by the Warrnambool Technical School, and as the main venue for the local basketball competition. The Warrnambool Technical College took over the premises in February 1960 and the Orderly Room currently houses the Student and Learning Centre of the South-West TAFE.</P>",

The monument was a tribute to their fallen comrades. Regimental monuments had a long history in British Regiments.There are a number of other memorials in Victoria, two are on the Victorian Heritage Register.

The names of the places in South Africa where the Victorians saw action are inscribed on the supporting pillars.

The builders were Pollard Brothers.</P>\r\n<P>The Sicree shelter is not typical of those structures commonly constructed in great numbers by citizens in their backyards after 1941. The shelter is far more elaborate and costly than the subsequent local examples, and is of reinforced concrete with a barrel-vaulted ceiling, escape hatch in the toilet compartment, hand basin, three bunks, two folding benches, and food containers.The level of comfort provided in the designfor the few occupants, also makes its unusual. The sophisticated design of the air raid shelter suggests a British influence. It was later shown that the extra effort and cost of elaborate subterranean concrete shelters was not justified by a corresponding improvement in protection. The shelter remains surprisingly intact. </P>\r\n<P>There is added significance in the association through the engineer, Isaacs, with the earliest official concern about home defence. Isaacs was a member of a sub-committee formed by the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects and the Institution of Engineers, Australia, Melbourne division.

In 1949, a forecourt was added to commemorate the service of soldiers in the Second World War. The site chosen for this great monument, a low hill on the axis of Swanston Street and embraced by a bend of St. Kilda Road, gives prominence and visibility from all directions and is crowned by the memorial building.</P>\r\n<P>The Shrine of Remembrance site is home to a large number of monuments, memorials and commemorative spaces and artworks relating to Victorians' war service. These include the Gallery of Medals, the Buttresses and the Tympana, the Crypt, the Sanctuary, the Stone of Remembrance, the Ray of Light, the Frieze, the Ambulatory and Books of Remembrance, the Second World War Forecourt, the Eternal Flame, the Cenotaph, the Remembrance Garden Post 1945 Memorial, the Legacy Garden of Appreciation, the Man and His Donkey statue, the War Horses Memorial, the <I>Cobbers</I> Statue, the Lone Pine, Unit Plaques and Memorial Trees. Futher information can be found at www.shrine.org.au.</P>\r\n<P>Between 1914-1918, 116,000 Victorian citizens volunteered to serve overseas in the Navy and the Army. Casualties were heavy and 18,000 Victorians did not return to their homeland. Many thousands more were wounded or rendered unfit. At a public meeting called by the Lord Mayor of Melbourne on August 4th 1921 a decision was made to build a permanent memorial. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The State Government and the Melbourne City Council allocated large funds towards the objective. As a result of the support given by Service leaders, in August 1926 sufficient money was raised by public subscription and after May 1927, tenders were called to proceed with the selected design. The Legacy Clubs of Victoria played a leading part in achieving this objective. In addition, the school children of Victoria raised funds and their contribution is perpetuated in the statuary on the Western and Eastern faces of the Shrine, representing the virtues - Sacrifice, Patriotism, Justice, Peace and Goodwill.</P>\r\n<P>A competition for the design of the First World War memorial was held in 1923, with the winning design by returned servicemen, Philip B. Hudson and James H. Wardrop, incorporating a distinctive interior space. Their monumental, classically conceived design, set on a series of elevated terraces within a formally planned landscape, caused considerable controversy in the press, however was finally adopted with some modifications, and the foundation stone was laid on Armistice Day 1927. Builders for the Shrine were Vaughan and Lodge, and architect Kingsley Ussher joined the architects' practice in 1929. After completion, the building was dedicated on November 11th 1934 by the Duke of Gloucester, at a ceremony attended by about 300,000 people. <BR><BR>Hudson and Wardrop's design for the Shrine is highly symmetrical with strong axial approaches from all directions. It drew on classical Greek sources in both form and detail and incorporated refinements to correct optical illusions, as undertaken in Classical Greece. The main form was based on the Mausoleum of Halicarnassos (353 B.C.) with a stepped reinforced concrete, pyramidal roof (originally clad externally in granite but reclad in copper sheeting in 1969) rising above a monumental cubic base. Octastyle Doric porticoes were applied to the north and south elevations, based on the Parthenon (447-432 B.C.), and a large finial, based on the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates, Athens, was included in the final design. Together these three sources combine to produce a building based symbolically on a tomb, temple and monument. The building is planned around a central sanctuary with surrounding ambulatory, a crypt below and two balcony levels above. The sanctuary receives light from a skylight in the centre of the distinctive stepped high ceiling and a feature of the space is the ray of light designed to fall across the sunken Rock of Remembrance at 11am on Remembrance Day. The perimeter ambulatory contains ensigns and books recording the names of all 114,000 Victorian servicemen who enlisted and served in the First World War. <BR><BR>The superstructure of the building is clad externally with pale grey granite quarried from a Tynong quarry, which was opened to supply the stone for this building. Stone sculptures were integral to the design of the exterior and British sculptor Paul Montford was commissioned to undertake this work. These sculptures include large winged figures buttressing the exterior corners of the Shrine and friezes for the tympanum of the porticoes. The interior sanctuary is square in plan and symmetrical about both axes, and incorporates sandstone cladding, a marble tile floor, sixteen dark Buchan marble Ionic columns and twelve frieze panels, designed by young sculptor, Lyndon Dadswell. The crypt is also clad in sandstone and has a ruled concrete floor and decorated coffered concrete ceiling. It contains a bronze casket containing the names of Shrine fund contributors and copies of the original drawings. In 1968 a bronze sculpture, Father and Son by Ray Ewers, was installed in the centre of the floor. <BR><BR>At the conclusion of the Second World War the Trustees of the Shrine took action to ensure that the enormous contributions by the men and women of Victoria to the years 1939-1945 should be likewise commemorated. In 1949 a competition was held for the design of a Second World War memorial. This was won by Ernest E. Milston with a design for a forecourt on the northern side of the Shrine, at a terrace level beneath the existing terraces. The forecourt, dedicated by the Queen in 1954, is designed in the form of a cross, and comprises an eternal flame and cenotaph on the western arm and three flagpoles on the eastern arm. The eternal flame is a brass bowl with gas-fired flame, surrounded by a low bronze rail fence and the most substantial of the three monuments, the cenotaph, is located behind this flame. The cenotaph consists of a basalt sculpture of six servicemen carrying the figure of a fallen comrade draped in an Australian flag, set high on a sandstone base. George Allen, the head of the sculpture department at R.M.I.T. from 1933 to 1965, won a competition to design the statuary. Opposite these memorials, across the forecourt, are three simple flag poles of painted steel tube set in simple granite slabs, originally intended to be mounted in urn shaped sandstone bases. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Then on 20th February 1955, the completion of the Forecourt and statuary was further marked with a special ceremony at which the Chairman of the Shrine Trustees, Lieutenant-General, the Honourable Sir Edmund Herring, KCMG, KBE, DSO, MC, ED, QC, unveiled the tablet on the Cenotaph recording the occasion.<BR><BR>Other important elements have been incorporated into the Reserve since its inception, and a collection of these are located to the north east of the Shrine. The Gallipoli Memorial, which incorporates a bronze sculpture of The Man with his Donkey, was originally located outside the Reserve in 1935, however was relocated in 1967. Located nearby is a granite horse trough, relocated in 1986 from its original position also outside the Reserve. It was erected as an initiative of the Purple Cross Society in 1926, dedicated to the welfare of the horses sent to the First World War. Also nearby are two life-sized bronze statues, Driver and Wipers, relocated from the State Library forecourt in 1998. The work of British sculptor Charles Jagger, these were originally purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria and installed after their arrival in Australia in 1937. <BR><BR>To the east of the Shrine is a statue titled Widow and Children which was commissioned by Legacy and dedicated in 1988. It is a small bronze sculpture by Louis Larmen, mounted on a grey granite block and set inside a cruciform shaped garden, known as the Legacy Garden of Appreciation. To the west of the Shrine is the Remembrance Garden, opened in 1985 to commemorate the service of Australian personnel in post-World War Two conflicts. Two lawn memorials, dating from c.1980s, are also located to the west of the Shrine, commemorating the service of the Australian Independent Companies Commando Squadrons and the World War Two Airborne Forces. To the south west of the Shrine is a fountain which was installed in 1934 to mark the centenary of Victoria and donated to the people of Victoria by noted philanthropist, Sir MacPherson Robertson. It was designed by the architects of the Shrine, Hudson and Wardrop, and features bronze statuary by Paul Montford. Other installations in the Shrine Reserve include four light pylons which were designed as part of the original design concept and constructed in 1934. Cast iron lamp posts, also dating from the original scheme, are arranged around the Shrine and along the southern approach<BR><BR>Landscaping around the Shrine began in 1933, providing employment for 400-500 men during the Depression. The design features strong axial north-south and east-west roadways and diagonal paths leading to and from the memorial, with plantings playing an important and symbolic role at the Shrine Reserve. About 114 memorial trees were planted around the Shrine in 1934, some later replaced or removed. Specific areas of trees around the Shrine were allocated to the army, navy and air force, and exotic trees representing the Commonwealth countries were planted in the north east lawn in the 1950s. A lone pine (Turkish pine, Pinus brutia), one of a small number of early trees grown in Victoria from a cone brought back from Gallipoli and planted in 1933, is situated to the east of the Shrine. Formal 1934 plantings of Bhutan Cypress (Cupressus torulosa) remain along the northern approach from St Kilda Road and other formal plantings, including that lining the southern approach and Lombardy poplars encircling the base of the grassed mound, remain from later periods. </P>\r\n<P>In 2003 the Shrine underwent a substantial redevelopment which involved the addition of foyers, visitor information spaces and facilities and two new entrances to the crypt via the previously unexposed undercroft. These additions are located beneath the existing mound on the north side of the Shrine and access is via courtyards, themselves aligned with the diagonal axes of the building. The visual impact of this work is minimal, however the approach to the building has been significantly altered with these new additions. Entry is now into the crypt, via the undercroft, rather than directly into the sanctuary on the level above. This allows for an educational process to occur prior to entry into the original, unaltered spaces. <BR><BR>When the project was conceived, Melbourne was the seat of Federal Parliament and this resulted in the grandest memorial in Australia, at least until the Australian War Memorial was built in Canberra in 1941. As the largest and most important war memorial in Victoria, it reflects the community's need for the commemoration of appalling sacrifice of life and an assertion of the nobility of the cause for which so many died. Its huge scale reflects the anguish of a generation.</P>",

It was announced in the Argus in 1932, that the cross would be set at an elevation of 3324 feet and floodlit at night, so that it would be visible from Melbourne. The cross was designed by Edward Campbell &amp; Sons of Melbourne, with the actual erection on site taking 25 hours. It was completed by 1935, with dedication services held on March 16th, when the cross was to be unveiled by His Excellency Lord Huntingfield KCMG. The unveiling of the Cross has generally been attributed to the State Governor, Lord Huntingfield, however, in the end the unveiling was performed by the premier, Sir Stanley Argyle.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Cross was described at its opening as, <EM>'Seventy feet in height with a plinth 14 feet in width, the Cross rests on a circular base 38 feet in diameter. The pale yellow stone, in relief against the sombre colours of the dense bush which clothes the Mount, is conspicuous for miles across the plains 2000 feet below.'</EM> </P>\r\n<P>On two sides of the cross in relief, two bronze crusader swords, each 25 feet long point to the ground. About the circular base are trim lawns, trees and shrubs. The Cross, floodlit at night, bears the inscription, <EM>'To the Glory of God and in memory of Australia's sons 1914-18'. Death cannot rob them of their Glory. Nor Time Efface the Memory of Their Gallant Deeds'</EM>.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Apart from its associations with the First World War, the cross is a symbol of Cameron's concern for the unemployed during the Great Depression, being a major project among others which he financed for unemployment relief work. Initially the Cross was not a favourable concept with anyone but those to whom it gave employment. People also thought the road should have been made before the Cross was erected rather than the reverse. Nonetheless, the cross has attracted long-term national and international tourism, due to its prominence and unique location, and has become one of the state's best known landmarks.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Cameron paid for the surrounding gardens and water storage, as well as the three mile road which linked the Cross with the Mount Macedon Road. In 1941, the road opened at a total cost of £30,000. Cameron also inspired the formation in 1944 of a committee of management, consisting of representatives from the Gisborne Shire, Forest Commission, the RSL and the Cameron estate. In 1953, after years of neglect local residents commenced fund raising for repair of the Cross and its surrounds. The residents paid £5000 to renew the elevation of the flood lights, erect a kiosk and caretaker's residence, clear the surrounding bush and restore the gardens. Constructed of Wunderlich terra cotta tiles on a steel base, the Cross has withstood lightning strikes and the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires.</P>",

The contract price for construction of the building was £25,947.</P>\r\n<P>The Depot exemplifies the build up of military preparedness in Australia in the years immediately preceding the Second World War. Together with another similar installation in Victoria Street Melbourne, the construction of this new drill hall reflected an expansion in military expenditure as the international situation grew tense. The Depot's location in the MelbourneCBD provides an interesting reminder of the important role played by the central city in all aspects of social, economic and political life until the second half of the 20th century.</P>\r\n<P>The Depot combines several stylistic influences, with colonial revival, art deco, classical and moderne elements. The art deco and moderne - in particular the modelled brickwork - touches gave it a contemporary feel, while the classical elements of the William Street corner conveyed a sense of conservative solidity appropriate for a major public building, especially one associated with the defence forces. While the building is no longer owned by the Army, its original use can still be clearly detected in the long, low form of the building, which contained two drill halls, classrooms and offices.</P>",

Built out of fear of Russian invasion, the fort was intended to defend the approaches to Melbourne in a triangle of fire between Queenscliff, Point Nepean (or Point Franklin), with artillery fire and a submarine minefield; however advances in technology had made the fort redundant by 1908. A jetty was also constructed between 1889 and 1901, as the fort was entirely dependent on sea transport for supplies.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The fort is an artificial island built up on 14,000 tonnes of bluestone boulders (which were transported from Bacchus Marsh) and concrete with sand overburden. It is 121.9 metres long, 76.2 metres wide and 6.4 metres high above sea level. The fortifications comprise a concrete and red-gum military dugout bunker system which is mainly underground with some areas breaking the surface as gun emplacements facing south and as a service yard facing north. The system includes ammunition magazines, kitchen, officer's quarters, storage areas and power room connected by a network of tunnels. The heavy gun battery originally consisted of five guns, of which only a 6 inch gun in the centre and an 8 inch 'disappearing gun' on either side of the island have survived.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The fort also used two electric lights as a defence. One had a fixed beam; the other a wandering beam to be used as a search light. The lights and other electrical equipment were powered by an oil generator. The fort is significant for its revolutionary design using camouflage and new methods of protection against bombardment, for its armament, and for its relative intactness</P>The sandy soil supports a shrubland of coast saltbush (<I>Atriplex cinerea</I>), seaberry saltbush (<I>Rhagodia candolleana</I>), bower spinach (<I>Tetragonia implexicoma</I>) and taupata (<I>Coprosma repens</I>).

In 1863, a site within the Public Purposes Reserve was gazetted for the use of the Castlemaine Rifle Corps and in 1872 a brick orderly room was built. The Castlemaine drill hall was built by D. J. Thomson jnr to drawings prepared by S. E. Bindley acting under chief architect H. R. Bastow of the Victorian Public Works Department. The design wasto provide expanded accommodation for the Castlemaine company of the Victorian volunteer rifle corps, formed in 1862. </P>\r\n<P>The first rifle corps was formed in Victoria as a result of the Volunteer Corps Act of 1854 and the first Castlemaine Rifle Corps was formed in 1860. By 1870 the volunteer movement was an entrenched institution in Victoria, however the popularity of the movement waned from this time and by 1880 the system was considered unsatisfactory. This resulted in the disbandment of the volunteers in 1884 and the new militia system adopted required more extensive and complex facilities. The government took over the ownership and management of existing orderly rooms at this time and consequently became responsible for their construction. As a result, an extensive programme of new building, additions, alterations and maintenance of buildings began in 1884-5. In the next six years, fifteen orderly rooms were completed to designs by the Public Works Department, including the Castlemaine Orderly Room. Although re-modelling of the existing brick building was initially considered, a decision was made to demolish it and construct a new timber building.</P>\r\n<P>The Castlemaine Orderly Room contained a large drill hall with auxiliary offices, storerooms and library along the east side. These functions are expressed externally in the massing of the building, with a large, double height section and an adjoining single storey section, and the use of corresponding large and small gables. The resulting character is picturesque and has been described as Elizabethan Domestic in style. Overhanging gable ends, containing collar ties and finials, are supported on timber brackets. The large gable ends of the main hall section contain timber infill panels with cut out lancet-shaped forms between timber posts, producing a half-timbered effect. Those of the smaller gables contain scroll-like carved panels. Pedimented window surrounds are notched at the sides, and sills are supported on brackets. Internally, the main hall contains exposed timber trusses and the floor was originally asphalted.</P>",

It is a typical example of the radar stations which formed part of a chain of such facilities established on Australia's coastline in the Second World War.</P>\r\n<P>No.16 Radar Station is a reminder of the increased presence and activities of the military in East Gippsland during the Second World War, and of the Australian Defence Forces' response to threat of direct enemy aggression and possible invasion. The Radar Station was of particular strategic importance during the Second World War because of its location on the eastern most tip of Victoria on one of the largest and most isolated parts of Australia's south eastern coastline. This section of coast formed part of an important shipping route and was thought to be a potential target for aggressive enemy action, particularly with increased military activity in the Pacific Region after Japan entered the war in 1941. The Radar Station provided coastal surveillance of possible enemy sea or air action and was considered an important part of measures necessary to ensure the safety of the shipping route. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The initial military installation on Gabo Island during the Second World War was based at the existing light station and operated as a Navy War Signal Station. The Station was manned by Navy signalmen and its main function was coastal surveillance. One of the light station residences was commandeered by the Navy for the accommodation of Naval personnel. This residence also provided accommodation for Navy personnel recuperating from injuries and trauma resulting from extended active service overseas.<BR><BR>In late 1942 and early 1943 large numbers of RAAF personnel arrived on the island and established the Radar Station. As many as 250 to 300 RAAF personnel are believed to have been stationed on the island at one time. The actual mechanism was set up on the highest point of the island with an asbestos cement hut located to one side. This area was enclosed by a fence. The Radar Station was treated as a top security military installation and was subject to a 24 hour guard. The camp for RAAF personnel was located on the North West shore of the island, along the beach near the present jetty.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Former Fort Franklin (Portsea Camp) was constructed between 1885 and 1889 as part of the system of fortifications of Port Phillip Bay to protect Melbourne against possible attack by Russian raiders. The outer defences in Port Phillip Bay consisted of forts at Queenscliff, and Point Nepean (Crow's Nest, Nepean and Eagle's Nest). A fort was required at Portsea to form part of the inner defences, together with South Channel Fort and Swan Island. The Fort Franklin site is spread over an area of about 3 hectares.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The fort was sited on land formerly occupied in the 1850s by the Watson family who came to Australia from Scotland in 1856. John Watson occupied an area of land which now forms part of the Portsea Camp and built a six room limestone house there, as well as a hut on the foreshore. The limestone house now known as the Commandant's house may date from the Watson period, prior to 1885. The land on which the fort stands was compulsorily acquired in 1885 from John Watson by the Victorian government at a cost of £1500. </P>\r\n<P>The task of Fort Franklin was to guard the South Channel, preventing enemy shipping using the South Channel and to provide a site for examination anchorage, where 'suspicious' ships were ordered to drop anchor and be searched while under the surveillance of gunners. Fort Franklin had the advantage of allowing the ships to be anchored close to the land and not too far up the Bay towards Melbourne.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>In 1887 the armament at the Fort consisted of three 80-pound muzzle-loading guns, but it was by then decided to substitute three breech loading guns on the disappearing principle. In 1892, Fort Franklin contained two 5 inch 3 ton guns, one 10 inch 25 ton gun, one 4.724 inch Quick Firing gun for sea defence and one 5 barrel Nordenfeldt field gun in case of land attack. </P>\r\n<P>The barracks building was constructed c.1885-89 to accommodate permanent and volunteer troops. The essential form of the buildings still survives. The staff cottage was on its present site by 1887. A small hospital ward was built, probably at the same time as the construction of the barracks and it is believed that five soldiers who had returned from the Boer War died there in August 1902. <BR><BR>Later military use during the Second World War necessitated the construction of underground bunkers and observation posts. The site was alsoused as an ammunition dump by the United States Army during the Second World War. One of the bunkers is believed to be an underground munitions store. Another partly underground structure to the west of the site was an observation post. The forward searchlight emplacement on the cliff beyond the gun emplacement was also constructed for use during the Second World War. The camp was also used as a migrant camp for a short time in the immediate post-Second World War period. </P>\r\n<P>In 1951-52, the army proposed to make Franklin Barracks an Officer Cadet School. This facility was established at the Quarantine Station site after objections by the Children's Camp Committee. Nonetheless the site was adapted for the Lord Mayor's Children's Camp (from 1946/47 to 1995) to enrich the lives of children from country areas by providing seaside holidays. Today, Fort Franklin barracks stands as the only surviving intact example of nineteenth century military barracks around Port Phillip Bay.</P>",

In 1867 cannons were installed at the site and a brass band was formed. The battery was made suitable for the addition two 68 pound guns in 1874, some on traversing platforms, and 80 pound RML guns acquired in 1877. The collection of weapons that were installed over its operational life is rivalled in Victoria only by the collection at Fort Queenscliff.

The site includes a grassed area, with a flagpole at the highest point. A bluestone powder magazine (c.1860s) is located a short distance away on the south bank of the Moyne River.</P>\r\n<P>Battery Hill was established as part of a rejuvenation of Victoria's militia forces in the mid-1860s and, more particularly, with the re-establishment of the Belfast (Port Fairy) Volunteer Corps in 1866. This was one of several important Volunteer Corps set up in Victorian coastal towns (a Volunteer Rifle Corps had been formed originally at Belfast in 1859). The revived corps were equipped with thirty, 2 pound weight MLSB cannons in 1867, the first battery named The Mills Battery, after the Harbour Master. The volunteers exercised with vessels of the Victorian Navy in 1873 and 1886. Regular practices for the complement of sixty to hundred personnel were held and the volunteers attended camps at Sunbury, Queenscliff and Portland, as well as conducting regional manoeuvres at Belfast. They also conducted competitive artillery practice with the Warrnambool detachment. Earthworks were thrown up in 1874 to support the introduction of sixty, 8 pound cannon and the thirty, 2 pounders were mounted on traversing platforms. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Battery Hill was further developed in the 1880s with the large-scale construction of fortifications and the acquisition of additional guns in readiness for a much-feared Russian attack. The fortifications were inspected by Sir William Jervois in October 1877 and new traversing platforms were supplied in 1880. Government expenditure on western ports resulted in plans for a more substantial battery in 1887, constructed by Messrs Lewis, Roberts and Glover and completed in October 1887. Two new 80 pound Armstrong guns on iron traversing carriages were installed and the thirty, 2 pounders were sold to the Borough for one pound in 1889 and located in the Botanic Gardens. The sixty, 8 pounders were positioned in King George's Square on the other side of the river in 1911. In 1984 all the cannons were assembled in the Battery Hill area.</P>",

The site has an entry from Point Nepean Road, and is partially bounded on the east by the Portsea Golf Club. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Point Nepean was a major part of the Victorian coastal defence system which made Port Phillip Bay reputedly the most heavily defended harbour of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century in the southern hemisphere. The fortifications at Point Nepean are the best examples demonstrating the development of military technology of the Port Phillip Bay network. Remaining buildings and structures from the defence use of the site include the gun emplacements, light emplacements, observation posts, tunnels, Pearce Barracks, Fort Pearce, Eagle's Nest, and the Engine House, and a number of archaeological sites such as Happy Valley, the site of a World War II camp. The fortifications are the best examples of the development of military technology of the Port Phillip Bay network.

Rifle, mortar, anti-tank and machine gun firing ranges were constructed in this area. The Lewis Basin was used for field training exercises, as evidenced by the obstacle course facility built in this area. The Monash Light navigational aid is located in this area, with a cleared tree/fire break maintaining an uninterrupted line of vision between the Light and the navigational beacon located at the western end of Ticonderoga Bay. This area has had limited disturbance over the past hundred years because it has been used only for defence activities. The area contained observation points associated with the fortifications, observation points for range firing at sea targets and range points for such firing. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Point Nepean also contains the oldest surviving buildings erected for quarantine purposes in Australia.

Candidates would complete a six-month course before appointment as second lieutenants. The school opened at the Portsea Quarantine Station on 5 January 1952 and the first graduation parade took place on 6 June 1952. In 1955, the course was extended to 12 months. The Officer Cadet School of the Australian Army took over the main buildings on the quarantine station site. Very small numbers of people were quarantined from that time until the official closure of the Quarantine Station in 1980. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Among the major Station buildings occupied by the Officer Cadet School were the five Hospitals, which were used for Officers Accommodation, Officers and Cadets Accommodation and Sergeants Mess. The Administration Building (constructed in 1916-17) became Army Headquarters, while the Medical Superintendent's Residence of the 1890s became the Commanding Officers' Residence. The Isolation Compound became the Officer Cadet School's Medical Centre.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>A number of new buildings were constructed at the Quarantine Station between 1963 and 1965 for the Officer Cadet School, some of a substantial nature. These buildings, which cost a total of £300,000 included No. 3 Cadet Barracks (1963), Assembly Room and Library (1963), Guardhouse and Entrance Gates costing £3,500 (1963), Gymnasium costing £25,000 (1965), No. 4 Officer Cadet Barrack costing £75,000 (1965).

D. Thompson, a director of clothing firm E. Lucas &amp; Co, Ballarat, that an avenue of trees be planted in honour of the men and women of the district who had enlisted for service. The planting of one tree for each enlisted person began in June 1917 with funds of £2,000 raised by the 500 women employed in the factory, known as the 'Lucas girls'. The planting, carried out in eight phases over the next two years until its completion in June 1919. The planting, done by staff of the Lucas factory with the support of local farmers included 23 species of trees, mostly exotic deciduous species planted in single lines along either side of the road at regular spacing of 10 - 12 metres. Each species was usually planted in blocks of about 25 trees on either side of the road. The trees were numbered and allocated to individuals as close as possible to their order of enlistment, beginning at the Ballarat end. Plaques were originally attached to each timber tree guards giving the individual's name, the unit in which he or she enlisted and their number in the avenue. In 1934 these were replaced by permanent bronze plaques at the base of each tree, of which more than 80% are still in place. </P>\r\n<P>During the First World War, the Avenue of Honour played a commemorative role and provided a stimulus for more people to enlist. Unlike other forms of memorials, avenues of honour and in particular the Ballarat Avenue required a high level of community participation in their creation which took place over a substantial period of time. Subsequently the Arch of Victory and Avenue of Honour became emblems of civic commitment to the war effort.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>There have been a number of changes to the Avenue of Honour. Several of the original 23 species did not flourish and were replaced with species of Elms and Poplars which are the dominant genera of trees in the Avenue. In 1997, the Avenue consisted of 3,332 trees of forty different species and cultivars. Approximately half were found to be of fair to poor health and a management strategy developed, including the replanting of some trees. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Avenue of Honour is of historic significance as one of the earliest known and the longest example of this uniquely Australian form of memorial. Planting of memorial trees had been common during the Boer War but the Avenue of Honour at Ballarat was an early planting of an avenue of trees along a roadside as a memorial, setting a precedent which was soon followed by the planting of 91 other avenues in Victoria, principally in Central Victoria, between 1917 and 1920.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Avenue of Honour is historically significant as representative of memorials that first appeared in Australia during the First World War commemorating not just the dead but all those who enlisted for service in an egalitarian form where each individual, regardless of rank, was equally recognised for their service. </P>\r\n<P></P>",

    "name": "Point Cook RAAF Complex",
    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The former Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base at Point Cook, near Werribee, Victoria, is Australia's oldest operational airfield and one of few pre-Second World War airfields in Australia. Point Cook has long been recognised as the birthplace of Australian military aviation (1913), and subsequently of the RAAF (1921). </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Point Cook Air Base is a level site running from Port Phillip Bay in the south to Point Cook Road in the north. There are two major built up areas located in the northern and southern sections of the site. In the north various functional zones and precincts include accommodation, community and administrative facilities and some hangars. In the south, closer to the seashore, are the major hangar and workshop areas. The two major built up areas are separated by the airfield, and a golf course. The parade ground of 1924-1930 acts as a functional element interfacing with the airfield to the south, which was formalised into the present runway system between 1930-1939. </P>\r\n<P>Point Cook's historic airfield was once part of the extensive pastoral run built up by the Chirnside family near Werribee during the latter half of the 19th century. In 1904 the Victorian Government bought more than 23,000 acres (10,454 hectares) of the Chirnside holdings for subdivision into small farms under its Closer Settlement Act. A few years later, with the threat of war looming in Europe and a growing appreciation of the possibilities of aircraft in military roles, the Australian Government decided to establish an air training base at Duntroon, near Canberra. Army experts from overseas quickly rejected that site as unsuitable, however, and proposed a better alternative, which could serve both land- and sea-planes, adjoining Port Phillip Bay on some of the former Chirnside land at Point Cook. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>In December 1913 some 730 acres (332 hectares) were purchased by the Federal Government as the site for its proposed Central Flying School. The first aircraft took off from Point Cook less than three months later, on March 1st 1914. Only 20 km south-west of Melbourne, Point Cook was the only military air base in Australia up to 1926, prior to the establishment of nearby RAAF Laverton (which with Point Cook became known jointly as RAAF Williams), and RAAF Richmond (formerly Clarendon) in New South Wales. It was thus the most important factor in fostering early aviation development in this country. Before the First World War the base was initially the home of the Central Flying School and, shortly after, the Australian Flying Corps of World War One. In 1921 the RAAF was formally inaugurated at Point Cook becoming the RAAF's pre-eminent training base. The former RAAF base at Point Cook thus represents perhaps the last remaining intact and truly historic airfield of this era anywhere in the world and is one of the world's oldest and best-preserved aerodromes still in existence.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The early focus on seaplanes closely associated the hangars and maintenance areas with the beach and required the construction of a jetty 1915-1916. Officers quarters and single men's barracks and married staff quarters were located to the north at the approaches to the base at this time. Within this housing, and later administrative, area the hierarchical system of housing reflects the ranks of the personnel at the base.In 1937 new entrance gates were added and a new Officer's Mess. During the war years eight new Service Flying Training Schools were established at Point Cook. These were housed in portable iron huts north of Dalzell Road, with new satellite airfields established to cater for the increased numbers. Fourteen Bellman Hangars were also erected at Point Cook. During the war women worked in the newly formed WRAAF, but were segregated from the men on the base.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Base also had close personal associations with Air Force officer Sir Richard Williams, who played a leading role in founding the RAAF. He maintained close connections with the Commonwealth's Chief Architect, John Smith Murdoch, who from 1914 to 1929 played a key role in early design of the Base. Flyers who graduated from Point Cook and went on to major roles in the later development of Australia's civil and military aviation include Richard Williams, Alan Cobby, Frank McNamara, George Jones, Lawrence Wackett, Ross and Keith Smith, Hudson Fysh, and John Duigan, as well as many other civilian pilots who were trained here. Many pioneering events took place as flights from Point Cook in its early days, including the first transcontinental flight to Darwin (1920), the first round Australia flight (1924), and the first non-stop flight to Perth (1928). Point Cook was a stopover on the first round-the-world flight in 1925, as well as being associated with flights undertaken by Australia's best-known early aviators, Charles Kingsford-Smith and Charles Ulm.<BR><BR>RAAF Point Cook remained the principal focus of military air training in this country for nearly 80 years, until June 1992. Flying training continues there, nevertheless, with the RMIT University still using part of the site for the practical aspects of its aviation degree tuition. The site also operates as the home of the RAAF Museum which has more than 70 aircraft from the earliest days of flight at various locations throughout the country. </P>",

The School had a strong military tradition, running a cadet corps from 1907. The site was provided by Ballarat Council and included an eighty acre farm to the north of the school for cadet training purposes. The main building was designed by Public Works Department architect John Hudson Marsden in the Federation style but was gutted by a fire in 1915 and the interior was rebuilt in 1916 to the design of Public Works Department architect HJ Kerr. A feature of the new building was an assembly hall known as Peacock Hall which commemorates the First and Second World Wars.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The hall was named Peacock Hall after the current Premier of Victoria and local member of Parliament, Sir Alexander Peacock, who opened the new school building on April 4th 1917. The hall is particularly associated with the conscription campaign of 1917, it was believed that support for conscription within the school was 20 to 1. Peacock Hall contains memorials to honour both academic achievements and military service by former students. One polished timber Honour Board listed those who died during the First World War. George Dancey was commissioned to complete a memorial mosaic mural tablet, the theme of which was the triumph of good over evil.</P>\r\n<P>On November 14th 1947, two Second World War Honour Boards were unveiled. One contained the names of 57 servicemen and one nursing sister who died during the Second World War, the other lists 632 returned service men and women.

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Kew War Memorial, on High Street and Cotham Road, was erected to commemorate the First World War. The War Memorial was unveiled by His Excellency the Governor of Victoria, Lord Stradbroke, before a very large gathering of citizens on August 30th 1925. A guard of honour was formed from the 39th Battalion and the First Kew Scouts. </P>\r\n<P>The Memorial is a particularly fine example of a classical style war memorial. Built in granite and marble as a circular temple supported on ionic columns, its design takes advantage of the site, allowing a clear view of all faces of the memorial. The frieze commemorates the theatres of war in which Kew residents served; the North Sea, Egypt, Belgium, Gallipoli, France, Palestine, Mesopotamia, and Salonica. In the centre of the temple is a square granite block with a central column. The western face of the block has the details of the purpose of the memorial and the occasion of its opening. The names of those servicemen and women who served in the Great War and of those who died have been inscribed on the other three faces. </P>\r\n<P>The memorial was planned from June 1919 when the Kew Municipal Council appointed a sub-committee to consider a suitable design. Steps were taken to secure land in front of the Post Office for erection of the War Memorial. The Mayor Cr H. W. Tompkins, also an architect submitted a design for the proposed Memorial, and it was decided that an estimate of the cost be obtained. In August 1920, the land in front of the Post Office was transferred to the Council. The Jubilee Fountain on the site was moved to the Alexandra Gardens and a large Moreton Bay fig tree which had been surrounded by seats for the public was removed to make way for the Memorial, despite local protests. </P>\r\n<P>It was decided to hold a competition for the design of the War Memorial. The estimated cost was not to be more than £3500. Prizes offered were £50, £15 and £10, with the proviso that the Council was not bound to accept any design. The results were announced in July 1921: the first prize was won by F. Bruce Kemp, the second prize by Stephenson and Meldrum. Although Mr Kemp was commissioned by the Council to prepare working drawings, specifications and detail drawings suitable for calling tenders for construction, the Council later decided to reject the Kemp design and to construct the Memorial according to the original design of the former Mayor, H.W. Tompkins. Mr Tompkins had since resigned form the Council and who offered to supervise the construction without fee. </P>\r\n<P>After the Second World War, George Allen was commissioned to complete a Civic Memorial in the form of a sculptured panel symbolising the sacrifice of those who served. It was incorporated into the new City Hall building completed in 1960. </P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>Fort Gellibrand, Williamstown, was constructed between 1889-93, to plans by Sir Peter Scratchley. Many of the pre-1900 buildings have been demolished and replaced with modern structures. Notable remains from the fort's original structures are the artillery store (1860), magazine (1860's), and a series of 8 gun emplacements dating from 1887-1889. The site also includes a timber colonial drill hall (built 1884-1901) and married quarters, two nine inch twelve ton, rifled muzzle loading Armstrong mounted guns in emplacements and some magazines and stores left from the 1930s and 40s when the area was used as an artillery proof range. The area contains the only remaining battery from four nineteenth century batteries built at Point Gellibrand. The Battery was subsequently developed as a defence facility and is still utilised by the Department of Defence. </P>\r\n<P>The Fort was built in the period from the 1850s to the turn of the century when a series of coastal defensive works were built in the Colony of Victoria in response to a perceived threat of attack from hostile warships. Particularly authorities were concerned about the vulnerability of Melbourne to raiding warships during the gold rushes. A battery emplacement was first established in 1855. The semicircular redoubt housed nine guns, with a magazine halfway back to the lighthouse. This battery and another of six guns at Sandridge, were the only shore defences up until the early 1860s. With the acceptance in 1861 of the plans of Royal Engineers Captain Scratchley for defence of Hobsons Bay, this battery became known as the 'left' battery, being one of four batteries at Point Gellibrand. The Williamstown batteries were part of a system of shore defences which stretched from the Point across Hobsons Bay and along the foreshore to Point Ormond. New batteries were built at the Cricket Ground, at the end of Breakwater Pier, and at the Fort. </P>\r\n<P>The technology of artillery was developing rapidly in this period and the batteries were changed to accept, and protect from, new types of guns. By the end of the 1870s, only the Fort Gellibrand batteries were maintained, and the Lighthouse Battery was dismantled in the 1880s or 1890s. Improvements were made to the Point Gellibrand batteries in 1871. Convicts from the hulks moored offshore were employed on these works and accommodated in an old military barracks at the Fort. The buried central magazine at the Fort dates from this period. The most expansive period of building of shore defensive works in the State was the late 1880s and early 1890s. By this stage the primary defences of Port Phillip were located at the heads, but Fort Gellibrand batteries were also upgraded in this phase. The batteries have retained up to the present their original commanding view over low level clear open space to the Bay.<BR><BR>Fort Gellibrand is historically significant as a major and integral link in the Victorian Colonial Coastal Defensive System of Port Phillip Bay, embracing fortifications from Point Nepean on the eastern Heads of the Bay, to Fort Queenscliff on the western side, thus making Port Phillip Bay reputedly the most heavily defended harbour of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in the southern hemisphere.</P>",

In 1885 additions were made in the form of attached offices, a new transverse hall and a sergeant-major's quarters (since demolished). These additions were designed by Victorian Public Works Department architect Samuel Bindley and their detailing is typical of many other drill halls of the period. In 1937 a brick addition was made to the north end of the 1864 building in the moderne style and the 1864 hall was given a jarrah floor to replace the former asphalt. The drill hall has been used by a variety of army units including infantry, artillery, ordnance and survey. The 1864 hall still has an extensive shingle roof under its corrugated iron.<BR><BR>",

In common with parks, showgrounds and racecourses across Australia, Royal Park was taken over early in the Second World War for defence accommodation purposes. Royal Park was offered to the Department of Defence by the City of Melbourne in April 1940 and by June was operating as a recruit reception depot with personnel accommodated in buildings and tents. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>In early 1942, a large part of Royal Park was used briefly as a staging camp for US troops on route to the Pacific. The Americans called their area Camp Pell, a name which immediately became associated with the military occupation of Royal Park. Anzac Hall is a simple and functional building principally of timber and corrugated iron very like recreation halls at other major encampments, its only unusual features being its composite timber and steel rod roof trusses and its sliding and folding door system. There are also some quaint stone sentry boxes, gateposts, stairs and retaining wall nearby. At the end of the war Royal Park became the principal demobilisation centre for all Victorian service personnel. After the war the larger area known as Camp Pell was used by the Housing Commission as emergency housing until its demolition during a clean up campaign leading up to the 1956 Olympics. </P>\r\n<P></P>The army remained in its corner of Royal Park near Anzac Hall until 1958 when it moved its personnel depot function to Watsonia.

It served throughout the Second World War as a satellite to the nearby Point Cook and Laverton RAAF airfields. The aerodrome consisted of five timber trussed hangars, a workshop building and an area of accommodation and administration buildings. The airfield was grass with no formed runways. In 1952 the land, including the buildings was returned to the MMBW.

Hangar 1 especially provides an example of the largest clear span timber trussed building seen in Victoria.

At Werribee only one of the five hangars was as large as130 feet in itsspan. Timber was used for these buildings because of the shortage of other building materials and because the type was well understood by American engineers on the Allied Works Council. After 1942 this method of construction of aircraft hangars was abandoned in Victoria in favour of the prefabricated steel Bellman type hangars, of which scores remain throughout the State. The Werribee buildings, are clad in corrugated iron and asbestos cement, have concrete floors and aprons, and full height sliding doors.

The site comprising the Mont Park and Strathallen estates was consolidated by the Victorian government when it was purchased from the Closer Settlement Board in 1909. The Mont Park Hospital commenced in 1910 with the building of the Farm Workers Block (later part of Kingsbury Training Centre). The other hospitals were gradually split off from the Mont Park administration to form separate entities. These were the Macleod Repatriation Hospital (1915), the Bundoora Repatriation Hospital (1920), the Gresswell Sanatorium (1933), Larundel Mental Hospital (1938 opened 1951), the Plenty Mental Hospital (1963) and the Kingsbury Training Centre (1974).

    "name": "Swan Island Fort",
    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Swan Island Fort was established as part of the Port Phillip Bay defence scheme in 1879. There had been concern about harbour defences in the colonies from 1858, and the Russo-Turkish war of 1876 heightened international tensions about conflict in the Pacific Ocean. The fort is comprised of about 140 hectares and is located 3km north-east of Queenscliff. Between 1879 and 1921 the island was associated with the Victoria Military Forces, the Royal Australian Engineers and the Royal Australian Artillery, encompassing an important period in the formation of the Australian Defence Forces.</P>\r\n<P>In 1877 a scheme was designed by Colonel Dummond Jervois (Deputy-Inspector General of Fortifications in Britain) and Captain Peter Scratchley. It was designed to defend shipping in Port Phillip and Hobson's Bays, and envisioned a threat by a raider cruiser squadron. The scheme, involving massive expenditure, comprised a forward defence system of forts at Port Phillip heads dominated by Fort Queenscliff and South Channel Fort (artificial island), and a network of coastal batteries. Some development of fortification had occurred in the 1850s, but it was the impetus of the Jervois-Scratchley reports which led to major work being undertaken in the 1880s. The overall defence plan involved a combination of guns, mines (known as electric torpedos) and ships to defend the entrance to Port Phillip Bay. Swan Island Fort would be used to protect the minefields in the harbour, and to engage enemy shipping that managed to pass the primary defences of Forts Queenscliff and Nepean. As a result, Swan Island Fort was also designed as a submarine mining depot. New gun technology in the form of Armstrong's powerful chambered, long guns, meant the Fort could be sited at a greater distance from the channel. Jervois accordingly modified his plan for a West Channel shoal fort in favour of Swan Island.</P>\r\n<P>The Swan Island Fort exemplifies late nineteenth century British military fortification design, including a distinctive V-shaped battery sited low and close to the sea, a rear garrison or keep, and extensive use of concrete, parapets and bursting layers of sand and concrete. The initial design of the battery included five heavy guns (three new type 10in Armstrong Rifled Muzzle and two 9in rml), plus two eighty pounder for defence of the flanks and rear. Mines were laid as part of an inner line of defence. Unemployed labourers constructed the basic earthwork faces, and ponds and swamps were created as a result of soil being dug from parts of the island. The design was amended in the early 1880s after a study of the Royal Navy's bombardment of coastal defences in Egypt, and the introduction of Armstrong's hydropneumatic gun carriage (5in hp guns). By 1887 construction was mostly completed, urged on by a war scare, and the establishment of a Victorian Department of Defence. In 1894 the final Fort design included gun positions, magazines, pump chambers for the 5in hp guns and lamp passages developed by RE officers at the London War Office.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>By 1900, the Swan Island fortifications were inadequate for engaging modern warships, and the Fort was used primarily for instructional schools and field training, supporting the Countess of Hopetoun, (the principle harbour vessel, maintaining permanent submarine mining defences, and as a military camp. The Royal Australian Artillery Regiment assumed control in 1903, and the island continued as a training area duringthe First World War for Signals, Field and Fortress engineering schools. The transition of the island from an army establishment to a full naval facility was completed by 1922. In 1920 it became a Permanent Mines Depot for the RAN to store explosives, and the seventy six buildings on the island were adapted as part of the RAN's construction program for its mine defence scheme. The Army retained use of a jetty and the rifle range. The decommissioned J-3 submarine hull was brought to the island to provide emergency power to enable a mine preparation works program to be implemented, and it also provided a deep water jetty. <BR><BR>A road and firebreak system was established in 1939-40, replacing the 3ft gauge tramway that had serviced the Fort and connected the island with Queenscliff. With the Second World War came expansion of facilities (eleven new buildings and trolley lines), and the mobilisation of female personnel. The island depot stored, prepared and delivered mines and depth charges for laying off New Guinea. After the war it continued to function as RAN's mine depot, and bulk storage of explosives. The Mine Depot was finally closed in 1960, when Mk17 mines were no longer required in the Asian and Pacific region, and a new explosives jetty was built at Point Wilson. The redundant depot contained 119 structures (including forty three built by the RAN), sealed roads, bridges, three jetties, and sixteen groynes to prevent beach erosion. (Four buildings on the eastern shore were abandoned in 1959 due to threat by erosion). In addition, the island featured a golf course constructed by the Queenscliff community in 1919. The Army was granted long term permissive occupancy in 1960 to use the former defence facilities as a training area. <BR><BR>Between c 1940-72 a series of beach preservation works were constructed to prevent beach erosion and damage to army facilities caused by shifting sands on the shoreline. The degree of shoreline movement is due to waves, tidal current, wind blown sand and the existence of man made structures on the foreshore. The groyne fields proved to be ineffective because of an irregular supply of sand, apparently caused by the Queenscliff boat harbour built in 1956 causing sand to be trapped by the training wall.</P>\r\n<P>The Swan Island Fort still contains a series of eight gun emplacements (including two rapid gun fire emplacements, although the guns have since been removed) facing east and south-east set behind a mound extending along the eastern side of the V-shaped fort, and ranging from 12ft-20ft high. An eight foot high platform provides access to the gun emplacements. The embankment contains a network of underground tunnels, including the former command centre at the southern end. The 7,660 yards of 3in gauge tramline that once traversed the centre of the fort (north-south) was dug up for scrap in 1959 and no traces remain although the current main road on the island follows the original route. At the northern end of the fort are several buildings contained within the Barrack Square surrounded by a 12ft high mound. This area originally contained an office, library, commanding officer's office, store for West Channel Defences, store for South Channel Defences, general store, loaded mine store, and smith and carpenter building.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Warragul Drill Hall,at 40 Alfred Street, wasbuilt between 1912-13. The Hallwas the first of about forty timber and iron drill halls built in Victoria between 1912 and 1916 and was the prototype for all of this type built in Australia following the introduction of compulsory universal military training in 1911. The opening of the Warragul Drill Hall was an important mile-stone in the military history of Gippsland, indeed Australia. It was the first Drill Hall built by the Commonwealth Government, and the first to be built on land donated by the people of a Shire to that Government. Built originally for the Warragul, Drouin and Trafalgar area to house the 46th Infantry, 13th Light Horse and 45th Cadets, the drill hall has been home to a number of units including:</P>\r\n<P>'A' Squadron, 13 (Gippsland) Light Horse Regiment; 'A' Company, 45 Battalion Senior Cadets; 'F' Company 46 Infantry Battalion (Brighton Rifles); 'G' Company, 48 (Kooyong) Infantry Battalion; 52 (The Gippsland Regiment) Infantry Battalion; HQ South-Eastern Group VDC; 'A' Company, 11 Battalion (VDC); 2 Field Regiment (RAA); 31 Medium Regiment (RAA); 2 Recovery Company (RAEME); 1 and 3rd Recovery Platoons (RAEME).</P>\r\n<P>It also served as a recruiting centre during both world wars, a prisoner of war control centre from 1944 to 1946, a sports facility, and is currently used for gymnastics classes. </P>\r\n<P>The drill hall is a timber-framed, corrugated iron clad building with an iron roof, semi-circular ridge vents, and steel trusses. There is a timber louvre vent in the gable at each end of the hall. The building comprises a major hall space and a skillion section along the east side with nine small rooms designed as offices and stores which have since had their partition walls removed. In 1939 a timber floor was laid over the building's original asphalt floor. The drill hall has been owned by the Shire of Baw Baw since 1995.</P>\r\n<P>Commonwealth architect John Smith Murdoch was probably responsible for the generic design, apparently developed from Queensland models, in response to the Minister for Defence's stipulation that \"the cost of drill halls was to be put down to bedrock\". Although the drawings for the Warragul Drill Hall were signed by Thomas Hill, Works Director, and Horace J Mackennal, draftsman of the Victorian Public Works Branch of the Commonwealth Department of Home Affairs, Murdoch had ultimate design responsibility.</P>\r\n<P>Restructuring of the Australian Commonwealth Military Forces on 28 May 1912 and the introduction of compulsory military training highlighted the need for additional training depots -Drill Halls -in suitable locations. Warragul members of the Australian Natives Association (ANA) recognized the hardships of training men and cadets were course calling a public meeting for Thursday 12 June 1912. At this meeting, a committee presided over by Cr. H E Dorrel, a deputation was appointed to approach the Warragul Shire Council to lobby for the construction of a Drill Hall at Warragul. Timing of the deputation was impeccable, for just prior to the offer being made, the Federal Government allocated an amount of £80,000 for the purchase of land and the construction of Drill Halls throughout Australia. Warragul Shire Council donated a block of land adjoining the showground and recreation reserve and on 13 August 1913 the Warragul Drill Hall was opened at a cost of £1250. </P>",

It is located on the eastern side of the Bacchus Marsh township and extends for approximately 2.9 km along Bacchus Marsh Road from Pearce Street in the west to the flag poles on either side of the road approximately 300 metres before the Lerderderg River. The dedicated Avenue of Honour sits within a longer avenue of elms which provides a continuous visual link. There are some older trees at the town end from main street plantings in the 1880s, and a younger section of trees planted in the east following road realignment work in the 1960s. The site is part of the traditional land of the Wathuarung people.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The planting ceremony on 10th August 1918, well before armistice on 11th November 1918, was a community effort attracting one thousand spectators, with workers from the Darley Firebrick Company and other volunteers digging the holes and erecting tree guards in readiness for the planting. After a bugle call relatives simultaneously planted in the 281 Dutch elms with each tree representing an individual soldier. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Bacchus Marsh Avenue of Honour is largely intact and comprises predominantly mature, healthy elms planted in pairs approximately 20 metres apart. Some replacement planting has occurred. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Each tree is dedicated to an individual soldier in alphabetical order to keep families together and was originally protected by timber guards with attached copper embossed name plaques mounted on a wooden block giving the soldier's name, rank and battalion details. As the guards collapsed and timber frames were removed many of the name plaques were either lost or attached to the trees by the 1950s. In the early 1960s the Country Roads Board replanted some new trees after road realignment work and installed new green bevel-edged hardwood name plaques on white hardwood posts. In the late 1960s and 1970s missing name plaques were replaced with embossed aluminium name plaques on hardwood backing plaques which was likely to be the first systematic replacement of the name plaques. By the late 1980s cast aluminium name plaques were being attached to the trees. In the late 1990s some caste bronze name plaques were mounted on the trees. In 2009 the plaques were removed for restoration and remounted in 2010. The 84 remaining original plaques are in varying condition are held in storage at the Shire Offices.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Avenue of Honour was part of the Western Highway from the date of planting through to the completion of the Bacchus Marsh by-pass in 1972 when it was again declared as a main road. The Avenue of Honour provides an impressive visual and cultural landmark at the eastern entrance to the town and is a key landscape feature of the district characterised by the curved road with the overarching canopies of the mature elms. The rural landscape complements the avenue providing views of dedicated fruit and vegetable production in the east changing to light industrial and residential use at the western end with several produce sales outlets along the road. </P>\r\n<P>In Australia, commemorative trees have been planted in public spaces since the late nineteenth century. Arbor Days were held regularly in most Victorian State Schools during the late 1800s and early 1900s, and numerous trees were planted in parks in Melbourne and throughout Victoria to mark the visits of important and famous people. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>This tradition of commemorative planting was continued in 1901 when at the end of the Boer War trees were often planted for each soldier of the district who was killed in South Africa. These plantings, however, rarely consisted of more than two or three trees in each town.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>During and after the First World War avenues of honour consisting of trees lining significant streets became a popular form of commemoration. They represented a new egalitarian approach to the commemoration of soldiers where rank was not a consideration: each tree symbolises a person.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Avenues of honour are a uniquely Australian phenomenon. Australians, and in particular Victorians, embraced the idea of planting them more enthusiastically than any other country in the world. The Eurack Avenue of Honour is the earliest known avenue of honour in Victoriawith planting commencing in May 1916.\r\n<P></P>By the time of the Second World War avenues of honour had declined in popularity as a means of commemoration. Today it is estimated that over 300 avenues of honour have been planted in Victoria to commemorate service personnel since 1901.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Eureka rebellion was a brief demonstration of armed conflict against injustice, its events have a special association with the Australian community and have been bestowed with tremendous emotional value. Factors leading to the rebellion included the hated gold digging licence fee and the unjust administration system used by the Colonial Government to control the goldfield population. <BR><BR>The Eureka rebellion is a defining and shaping event in the nation's history. The rebellion's shock waves had a great impact on the society of the day helping to carry and sustain drives for constitutional reform, such as manhood suffrage and vote by secret ballot. Eureka was also directly responsible for a government policy shift on the land question, making it easier for ordinary working class people to acquire land for farming and other purposes. Importantly for the development of an Australian character, the uprising quickly took on heroic and legendary status and is now the Australian symbol for people striving for a \"fair go\".<BR><BR>After the rebellion, the Eureka battlefield returned to its normal use: gold mining and habitation. A significant and enduring issue in respect to the place post-battle has been the identification of the exact location of the Stockade. The first official attempt to do so occurred in 1869 when the Town Clerk of the Ballarat East Town Council identified an area of 12 acres and 2 roods. Originally called the Eureka Street Stockade Reserve, the land was described by Henry Morres in 1870 as containing the greater portion if not the whole of the stockade.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Eureka Street Stockade Reserve (officially gazetted as the Eureka Park and Gardens in 1885 and now known as Eureka Stockade Reserve) developed gradually. The Reserve's main development period was from 1912 to 1964. This involved the extension of the boundaries of the Reserve and physical developments such as a rotunda, two lakes, a nursery, tree plantings, formal gardens and paths, drinking fountain, small and large halls, memorial gates, Lake Elsworth Swimming Pool, and a Caravan Park. Today the Reserve bears little resemblance to its original character. <BR><BR>The most notable attempt to locate the exact site of the Stockade was in 1884 when a commemorative monument was proposed for the reserve. Several hundred old timers gathered at Eureka Street on 26 June 1884 and after heated debate they agreed to disagree and voted on a site in the south east corner of the reserve. The monument began its life as an octogard body of bluestone ashlar work in two tiers with four 64-pounder guns: later a twenty-foot tall stone plinth was added. <BR><BR>Academic endeavours over the last thirty years have so far placed the likely location of the stockade within the blocks bounded by Belford, George, Charlesworth, Stawell and Eureka streets. Some have championed the bipartisan spot selected in 1884; others have put the Stockade varying distance to the west of the monument. Factors cited as working against any resolution are the contradictory historical accounts of the battle, the physical transformation of the topography since 1854 and the ephemeral nature of the Stockade (the possibility of any sub-surface features surviving is low).</P>",

Giddings' body was recovered on the 18th March 1942. In 1967 during a drought the wreck became exposed and the engine was retrieved by the Heyfield community (present location unknown). The wheel and undercarriage leg are displayed to public at the dam (weir wall).The port wing was recovered and restored at Australian Aircraft Restoration Group (Moorabbin Air Museum) A20 CAC Wirraway Registration A20-404.

Wackett led a mission abroad to select a general purpose aircraft for manufacture by the newly-formed Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC). The mission unanimously recommended the North American NA-33, and plans were made to produce a modified version to be known as the Wirraway (aboriginal for challenge). Whilst the CAC buildings were being erected at Fishermen's Bend, two aircraft were shipped from America for evaluation and the first, a fixed undercarriage NA-16 which overseas became known as the Yale, arrived in mid 1937 and was transferred from CAC to the RAAF on February 2 1938. The second aircraft, a NA-33, arrived late in 1937 and was taken on charge at No 1 AD from CAC on November 8 1938. For some time, these two aircraft remained un-numbered, but later became A20-1 and A20-2 respectively. In June 1940 the two aircraft were transferred to the Engineering School as instructional airframes. </P>\r\n<P>Subsequent to RAAF selection, the NA-33 was ordered by other air forces and it became known as the Texan in America and the Harvard throughout the Empire. The Australian Wirraway version was modified for operations, and the NA-33 single wing-gun was replaced by twin synchronised guns in blast troughs above the fuselage, plus a flexible gun in the rear cockpit. Camera and radio installations were introduced, and the wing and tail units were redesigned and strengthened for dive-bombing in later variants only.</P>\r\n<P>The first Wirraway, A20-3, was test flown by Flt. Lt Boss Walker on March 27, 1939, and the first three RAAF Wirraways were accepted in July 1939. By December 1940, seven aircraft were being delivered weekly, and by September 1941, 45 Wirraways per month were coming off the production line. The initial orders for 620 aircraft were completed by June 1942, but limited production continued until 1946 when the 755th Wirraway, A20-757, was delivered. CAC designations for Wirraway orders included CA-1, -3, -5, -7, -8, -9, -10 (a bomber version which was cancelled), -10A (dive bomber), and -16. The designation CA-20 covered the conversion of Wirraways for the RAN. </P>\r\n<P>In 1940/41, camouflaged Wirraways were deployed to forward bases in Malaya (No 21 Sqn) Rabaul (No 24 Sqn), and Darwin (No 12 Sqn). On January 6 1942, Flt Lt B. Anderson, of No 24 Sqn became the first RAAF pilot to engage in air-to-air combat in the South-West Pacific, when his Wirraway intercepted a Kawanisi (Mavis) flying-boat over Rabaul. Two weeks later, on January 20, 1942, the Rabaul Wirraways achieved immortal fame when eight aircraft, including A20-177, piloted by Sgt W Hewett, courageously engaged a force of over 100 Japanese fighters and bombers. Although hopelessly outclassed by enemy aircraft, the Wirraway remained in the front line as a stop-gap fighter, and on December 26 1942 Wirraway history was made when Plt. Off J. Archer, in A20-103, succeeded in shooting down a Zero near Gona. Wirraways served mainly with Nos 4, 5, 12, 14, 21, 22, 24, 25, 54, 60, 78, 82, 85 and 87 Sqdns, although most squadrons had Wirraways on strength at one time or another. In addition, the aircraft was used extensively for the Empire Air Training Scheme, and many Australian fighter pilots learnt their trade in the Wirraway. The Wirraway continued to serve as a trainer and communications aircraft until 1959 and of interest is the fact that a Wirraway was used in 1947/48 by No 81 Wing whilst on duty with the BCOF in Japan.</P>\r\n<P>Today, Wirraways can be found at Bull Creek, WA, the Australian War Memorial, Moorabbin Air Museum and the RAAF Museum and several more are under restoration. These examples are on hand to remind us of the first Australian mass-produced aircraft - a tribute, in one respect, to Sir Lawrence Wackett who had the foresight and ingenuity to provide Australia with an efficient aircraft in a time of need.</P>",

The first aircraft flew on August 19 1940 and, subsequently, almost 11,000 versions operated with Allied airforces throughout the world. Officially designated the B-25 the bomber was later named the Mitchell in honour of General Mitchell who had been court-martialled in 1925 for his outspoken views on air power. In 1942, the RAAF accepted a number of Mitchells on behalf of the Dutch Government. These aircraft equipped No 18 (Netherlands East Indies) Sqn and by 1945, 150 Mitchells of various marks had been received. In April 1944, No 2 Sqn replaced its Beauforts with Mitchells and the first 39 aircraft (A47-1/39) were transferred from No 18 (NEI) Sqn. A total of 50 Mitchells were operated by No 2 Sqn including 30 Mitchell IIs (A47-1/25, 33/37) and 20 Mitchell IIIs (A47-26/32, 38/50). The Mitchells of Nos 2 and 18 (NEI) Sqns formed No 79 Wing, and these aircraft carried out many successful strikes against enemy targets. At the end of the war, the Mitchells of No 2 Sqn helped evacuate and return many POWs, and the aircraft were finally phased out of service in 1946. ",

First ordered in 1935 as part of the RAAF's modernisation programme, the Anson was conceived as a general reconnaissance bomber and was initially used for maritime parol duties.

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>During the Second World War, an Avro Anson #W 1580 aircraft crashed at Lakes Entrance during a training excercise, remarkably the crew survived. The plane was piloted by F/Sgt. R. Stinton, taking off from Bairnsdale at 12.45pm on Tuesday May 30th 1944. The full crew were as follows:-<BR><BR>Flight Sergeant R. Stinton (pilot) from Swan Marsh near Colac<BR>Flight Lieutenant S.H. \"Hec\" Gowing (navigator) from Willowtree, NSW<BR>Sergeant K. Horne (wireless operator) from Warnambool<BR>Flying Officer Jack Woodward (navigator instructor) from Cairns<BR><BR>It was a bitterly cold day with a 30 knot wind and the crew were on a \"radius of action\" training exercise commencing from Lakes Entrance. After about 20 minutes, the pilot reported engine problems due to a burst oil pipeline. They were 40 miles off the coast when the pilot headed back towards the mainland. <BR><BR>The wireless operator advised the base that they had problems and were returning to the coast. Not long after the engine seized. At that time they were at 1,500 feet and should have been able to return to base on the other engine. However the pilot advised that he was losing revs in the remaining engine and he was losing height as a result of the reduction in engine power.<BR><BR>Gowing and Woodward started jettisoning equipment at the rear of the aircraft but they continued to lose height. The wireless operator was then asked to issue an S.O.S. unfortunately he did not send this signal.<BR><BR>As it was getting obvious that they would not reach the shore, the pilot turned the aircraft into the wind, and ditched the aircraft. The waves were large (around 30 feet) and the Anson hit one wave at about 40 knots and bounced into another wave near its crest. The heavy seas made it difficult to exit the aircraft into their rubber dinghy. The wireless operator advised that he was unable to issue the S.O.S. before they ditched as he did not have time to cipher the message. He was only a fresh recruit out of the W.A.G. school. <BR><BR>Gowing and Woodward were on the wing controlling the dinghy by a rope tied around a stay wire while they clung desperately to the wing strut. As the aircraft appeared to be floating quite satisfactorily they decided to stay on the wing rather than enter the dinghy. Woodward, with the pilot's assistance, recovered the aircraft's clock. It later took pride of place on the wall of his study at home. The salt water had its revenge as it never worked correctly after this accident.<BR><BR>Their base had determined that they must be in trouble and the standby aircraft, piloted by Jake Bond, was dispatched to search for them. Bond found them almost immediately. They had been in the water for one and a half hours by that time. As they were sighted by the search aircraft, they had to evacuate the Anson in a hurry as it was showing signs of an imminent departure to the depths of the ocean. <BR><BR>Jake Bond advised base of their location and before long another aircraft was circling their location. Eventually there were four Ansons circling overhead. As the day went on those in the dinghy started to feel the cold. Woodward was lucky enough to be wearing long sleeve woollen singlet, long john woollen underpants, and woollen socks, under his long RAAF trousers and shirt plus a summer flying suit and fleecy wool lined flying boots. The others cut up a parachute and used the pieces of the chute to help keep themselves warm.<BR><BR>By 4.30 pm the circling aircraft lost visual contact with the dinghy in the gloomy conditions. They were continually bailing water out of the dinghy which had been blown in as sea spray in the blustery conditions.<BR><BR>At about 8.00pm they heard the engine of a distant boat. They started to yell but this was not no avail. Twenty minutes later the boat was within 100 yards of their dinghy. The engine stopped and they all gave a load shout towards the boat. Unfortunately they had used all of their flares earlier to continue to alert the overhead aircraft of their position. <BR><BR>Just after 9.00pm the boat was within 20 yards of their dinghy, but still their shouting could not be heard. Fortunately a crew member on the boat shone a torch in their direction and spotted them. After over 8 hours at the mercy of the elements they were finally safe on board a fishing launch called the \"Lily G.\".<BR><BR>The skipper of the \"Lily G.\", was Jack Gray, who had his two sons with him on the boat along with another two friends, Harold Broome and Vic Carstairs. Stinton, Gowing and Horne were sent below decks, huddled in blankets, to warm themselves in the engine room. The \"Lily G.\" had no radio, so they were unable to advise their base that they had been rescued. Search aircraft continued to circle overhead.<BR><BR>It was more than half an hour before Jack Gray thought it was reasonably safe enough for the \"Lil G.\" to cross the bar at Lakes Entrance. After searching for the right wave for about 10 minutes, he finally turned the boat around and called for full throttle from his son. The boat rode the wave for some time, but suddenly the wave passed the boat and it hit the bottom, and swung almost side on to the waves. Fortunately a smaller wave lifted them off the bottom of the bar and took them into deeper water.<BR><BR>The crew contacted their base on arrival at the jetty and within 15 minutes the Commanding Officer and the Doctor arrived at the jetty. They travelled back to Bairnsdale where Stinton, Gowing and Horne were put into hospital. Jack Woodward was made a member of the Goldfish club \"by escaping death by the use of his Emergency Dinghy\".<BR><BR>On 1st September 1944 The Melbourne Sun Newspaper reported;<BR><BR>\"On the 31st August, 1944, John Gerald Gray, his two sons Norman Gray and Graeme Gray, Victor Keith Carstairs and Harold Broome received Royal Humane Society Awards at Government House, Melbourne. All received the Bronze Medal, except Vic Carstairs, who already held a Bronze Medal, and he was presented with a Bar to his previous award. The citation was for risking their lives in rescuing four airmen from drowning off the Ninety Mile Beach.\"<BR><BR>The A4 Avro 652 Anson, known affectionately as \"Faithful Annie\", has a special place in RAAF history as more of them - 1,028 - were operated by the service than any other type. It was also the RAAF's first low wing monoplane, the first with a retractable undercarriage and with a enclosed gun turret. First ordered in 1935 as part of the RAAF's modernisation programme, the Anson was conceived as a general reconnaissance bomber and was initially used for maritime parol duties. Deliveries of the first order of 48 aircraft began in November 1936 and were completed in September 1938. Allocated serial number A4-1 to 48 these aircraft served with Nos 2, 4, 21, 22 and 23 Squadrons on maritime patrol work. Although already obsolete as a front line aircraft before the Second World War started, the lack of any suitable replacement led to a further 40 machines being chartered from the British Government and these were delivered during 1938 and 1939. These aircraft retained their British serial numbers. Upon replacement in the maritime reconnaissance role by the Lockeed Hudson in 1940, the Anson found a new lease of life as a trainer for Observers and Navigators under the Emipe Air Training Scheme and no fewer that 937 Anson Mk. 1s were delivered to the RAAF between 1940 and 1944. These aircraft also flew with their original British serial numbers, and although most served with a variety of over 40 training units, some were fitted with ASV radar and patrolled the Eastern seaboard of Australia with Nos. 66, 67, 71 and 73 Squadrons. </P>\r\n<P>Technical Data<BR>(Avro 652 Anson) <BR><U>Description</U>: General Reconnaissance Bomber <BR><U>Other Roles</U>: Multi Engined Trainer <BR><U>In Service</U>: 1937 to 1950 <BR><U>Power Plant</U>: 2 355 hp Armstrong Siddley Cheetah IX Radials <BR><U>Weights</U>: Empty 5,512 lbs (2,500 kg), Loaded 7,955 lbs (3,608 kg) <BR><U>Dimensions</U>: Wingspan 56 ft 6 in (17.22 m), Length 42 ft 3 in (12.88 m), Height 13 ft 1 in (3.99 m) <BR><U>Performance</U>: Max Speed 163 kts (302 kmh), Cruise 138 kts (256 kmh), Service Ceiling 19,500 ft (5,944 m), Range 710 nm (1,315 km) <BR><U>Armament</U>: 20.303 machine guns, one fixed in nose, &amp; one in Dorsal turret; Bomb Load 360 lbs</P>",

Designed for all aspects of aircrew training, the prototype Oxford first flew in 1937, and was the military version of the Airspeed Envoy. The latter aircraft had tragic memories for Australians, for it was whilst flying an Envoy that Charles Ulm (an honorary RAAF Flight Lieutenant) disappeared between Oakland and Honolulu during his 1934 Pacific flight attempt. On the outbreak of the Second World War, Oxfords were selected as trainers for the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), and a total of 8,751 Oxfords served in Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Rhodesia, and the Middle East. </P>\r\n<P>In Australia, the prefix A25 was allocated for RAAF use but, as was the case with the Fairey Battles, the imported Oxfords retained their RAF serials. Altogether 391 Oxfords were shipped to Australia and the first aircraft, P6878, was received on October 28 1940 and the last, LW999 on March 20th, 1944. These aircraft included the Mk I with an Armstrong Whitworth dorsal turret, and the Mk II which had the turret removed and was employed mainly for pilot and navigation training. Known to trainees as the \"Ox Box\", the Oxfords were used at EATS schools for instruction in flying, navigation, gunnery, radio and bombing. In addition Mk II versions operated with Nos 1, 2 and 5 Communication Units. <BR><BR>In the years after the Second World War, Oxfords remained with the RAAF as trainers and communication aircraft until they were finally withdrawn from service in 1953. Together with the Avro Anson, the Airspeed Oxford was responsible for all initial multi-engined training in the RAAF for over a decade. <BR><BR>The XF 887 A25 Airspeed Oxford Mk II was a three-seat advanced trainer, with a wooden structure and plywood covering. It was powered by two 370 hp Armstrong Siddley Cheetah X. It spanned 53 ft 4 inches; length, 34 ft 6 inches; height, 11 ft 1 inch. When empty it weighed 5,380 lb; or when loaded, 7,600 lb. Its maximum performance speed was 188 mph; its climb, 960 ft/min; service ceiling, 19,500 ft.</P>",

After the First World War the Mechanics Institute needed new premises for a library and reading room, the RSSILA wanted clubrooms and the citizens of Jeparit needed a public hall. A committee made up of \"soldiers and citizens\" approached the shire council, who were planning to build new offices and chambers, with the idea of a combined building. The administrative centre of the Dimboola Shire had shifted from Dimboola to Jeparit in 1914 after years of increasing discontent in the northern section of the shire.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The committee raised the equivalent of approximately £4000 in cash and land and the shire council provided the remainder of the funds. The Ballarat firm of architects Clegg and Morrow designed the building and the local firm Lovell Dudden and Jones were the builders. The contract price was £7700 with about £400 for extras. On February 5th 1924, the foundation stone was laid by the Hon. Arthur Rodgers, former Minister for Trade and Customs and former assistant Minister for Repatriation.

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Avenue of Honour at Grenville is an avenue of Dutch elms on either side of the Buninyong-Mount Mercer Road, planted to commemorate the First World War. The avenue originally consisted of forty-four Dutch elms, thirty-four of which survive in poor condition. Each tree has a numbered plaque which corresponds to a list of soldiers names on a plaque at the southern end of the avenue. \r\n<P></P>In 1916 Fernside (later called Grenville) State School had raised £156 for the war effort. A public meeting in 1917 decided to plant an avenue of honour between two local properties, 'Fairlie' and 'Penrose'. When the war ended the committee decided to erect a memorial entrance to the avenue, comprising of seats and copper panels. In October 1919 George Turner wrote to the Shire Engineer, C.C.P. Wilson, saying that they had decided to erect it per the plans submitted by a Mr. Smith (probably H.H. Smith, Head of the Art School at the School of Mines Ballarat), who designed a number of war memorials, including the Arch of Victory in Ballarat. The form work was constructed in Ballarat by Wardle and Sons and Durham Lead contractor Andrew Wylie completed the work during 1920, with the locals labouring and supplying the sand and gravel. \r\n<P></P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The two Memorial Seats are placed at the southern end of the avenue so as to form a gateway to the avenue. They are constructed of concrete in the form of a concrete bench with two embossed copper panels set in a pillar at one end. On the eastern seat, an explanatory panel reads: \"This Avenue was Planted in 1917 in Honor of the Men of this District Who Served the Empire in 1914-1919.\" On the western seat, the explanatory panel reads \"These Tablets and Seats were Erected in 1920 to the Memory of those who Fought for Liberty and Justice in 1914-1919.\" A second panel on each seat lists the tree numbers for the elms on that side of the road with the names of the soldiers that each elm commemorates. </P>\r\n<P>Grenville was named by 1867 after a new goldmine operated by the South Grenville Company located there. It became the centre of a rich grazing area but by the end of the 20th century much of the infrastructure of the township had been removed, with the school being relocated to a private individual's property and the Union church relocated to Sovereign Hill. The Avenue of Honour, with its Memorial Seats, like the avenue at Eurack is all the more poignant because it commemorates those who served from a community which has now largely disappeared. </P>",

In all, 224 English Oaks (<I>Quercus robur</I>), Algerian Oaks (<I>Quercus canariensis</I>) and Oak hybrids (<EM>Quercus canariensis</EM> x <EM>Q. robur) </EM>were<EM> </EM>planted. It is one of only a small number of avenues in Victoria to use English Oaks. All trees once had memorial plaques to those who enlisted but they are now in storage in the Woodend RSL. </P>\r\n<P>The Avenue is planted on both sides of the road along a stretch of 2.5 kilometres in length, starting near Clarkes Lane and extending south to Woodend. A full list of allotted trees is given in the 1919 Woodend Star. The order in which the names were alloted is as follows: </P>\r\n<P><B><U>Trees 1 -72, east side of avenue</U>: </B>G. Anderson, F.H.Giles, J.E.Giles, H.Giles, AAnderson, J.H.Anderson, to G. Dunn.<B> </B></P>\r\n<P><B><U>Trees 1-90, west side of avenue</U>: </B>E. d'A Bruun, E.J.Christie, etc. to P.Tyrrell, J. Falloon, AW.Keating, W.W.Jones, W.McDonald, R.Simpson, Bowe, C.Blackburn, Brae Watson, A Armitage, E.F.Walsh, P.O'Neill, B. O'Neill, Thos. Forge, George Purchase Jr., Claude Huffer.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The difference in tree numbers from the east to west side is explained by the position of the road at one point which prevented the planting of a continuous double row. It is not known who supplied the trees but Smith &amp; Sons at Riddells Creek is a possible local supplier.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The avenue is an impressive visual and cultural landmark in the township of Woodend and provides an important definition of entrance and exit to the town as well as one of the most extensive memorials to those who served in the devastating First World War campaign.</P>\r\n<P>\r\n<P>A second avenue was planted, on the Tylden Road by the Woodend RSL, to commemorate those who fought in the Second World War, Korea and Vietnam. </P>\r\n<P>In Australia, commemorative trees have been planted in public spaces since the late nineteenth century. Arbor Days were held regularly in most Victorian State Schools during the late 1800s and early 1900s, and numerous trees were planted in parks in Melbourne and throughout Victoria to mark the visits of important and famous people. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>This tradition of commemorative planting was continued in 1901 when at the end of the Boer War trees were often planted for each soldier of the district who was killed in South Africa. These plantings, however, rarely consisted of more than two or three trees in each town.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>During and after the First World War avenues of honour consisting of trees lining significant streets became a popular form of commemoration. They represented a new egalitarian approach to the commemoration of soldiers where rank was not a consideration: each tree symbolises a person.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Avenues of honour are a uniquely Australian phenomenon. Australians, and in particular Victorians, embraced the idea of planting them more enthusiastically than any other country in the world. Dating from May 1916, the Eurack Avenue of Honour is the earliest known avenue of honour to be planted in Victoria. \r\n<P></P>By the time of the Second World War avenues of honour had declined in popularity as a means of commemoration. Today it is estimated that over 300 avenues of honour have been planted in Victoria to commemorate service personnel since 1901.</P>\r\n<P></P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Crows Nest Fort, located at 14 Esplanade, Queenscliffe Borough, was built in the Late Nineteenth Century. In 1886, an eight inch disappearing gun was placed at Crows Nest, much to the disgust of local residents as the location was a popular hill and they feared the loss of much loved local vegetation. The gun appears to have been active by 1891, as firing times and exclusion zones were announced in local newspapers. Tenders were called for a gun eplacment and 6lb Nordenfelt Gun at the fort in 1892, although it is unclear if these ever eventuated.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Fort is shown in defence plans as an obsolete single gun emplacement with a sloping external casement wall on the seaward end, with a depressed area to the north that housed the gun. From 1925- 1929, a one gun fort was located down near the Officers Mess, but that it was never fired during this time. A disappearing gun was mounted at Crows Nest, but was removed around the time of the Second World War as scrap metal was at a premium at that time, which resulted in many of the earlier guns being removed from the forts around the heads. A breech loading gun currently outside Fort Queenscliff is labelled as having originated from the Crows Nest Fort.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>In 1908, an Engine room and gun emplacements were built at Crows Nest. During the First World War the fort was used as an informal camp site by swagmen for many years after it was abandoned. The back beach was closed off from 1942 until the end of the war. There was barbed wire from the cliffs all the way around to Cottage by the Sea. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Locals reported that the Crows Nest Fort was demolished by the army with explosives in the 1960s. Additionally, other facilities, such as the Cottage by the Sea children's home was taken over by the army to house soldiers during the First World War which deprived sick children of their annual seaside holidays. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>John Patrick, a former local resident and member of the Queenscliff Historical Society undertook personal research for the sites:</P>\r\n<P>\"I remember it quite well. Crow's Nest Fort had a circular paved area for the gun, protected on the seaward side by a vertical concrete wall about 2.5 metres high. Beyond that protecting wall sand and concrete had been sited so the fort merged into the hill and was not easily detected from the sea. There was a circular rail inset into the circular paved area, presumably to enable the gun to be rotated. The original gun had been removed long before my first seeing the fort. There was at least one door opening in the west end of the concrete wall with steps leading down underground to what I presumed to be a place for storing ammunition.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>At the same level as the circular paved area was a further flat paved area, to the north reaching to a high wooden fence that ran along the northern boundary of the land and extended around part of the eastern boundary.Beyond that fence to the north was a wide piece of unoccupied land and the remaining land to Flinders Street was occupied by Upton House, a convalescent home for aged people and to the east of that The Cottage by the Sea operated by the Ministering Children's League.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>At some later stage the enclosed circular paved area had been covered by a flat galvanised roof and large doors had been fitted on the north side to enclose that area. It was used for military purposes during the Second World War. I believe those doors may have survived and are still in use in Queenscliff.\"</P>",

The Tatura group of camps held approximately 12,000-13,000 men, women and children of 23 nationalities, both prisoners and internees. </P>\r\n<P>Little remains in terms of above ground structures at the Prisoner of War Camp No. 1, Camp Road, Murchison, all buildings having been removed or demolished following the closure of the camp. The site now only contains various concrete foundations, timber posts and stumps, remnants of stone walling, fencing wire, coils of barbed wire and garden bed remnants. In addition there are the remnants of the concrete skittle alley, a tennis rebound wall, tennis court and a stone gateway at the entrance.<BR><BR>Compound A, Camp No. 1 was established in 1940 on land owned by John B Noonan near the Waranga Basin Inlet. Sixty three German internees were transferred 5km from 'Dhurringile' to the camp containing 14 huts, two mess halls, and open wash house, shower room and latrine. One hut was used as an orderly room and another, the temporary camp hospital. By 1943 sanitation was connected and the camp became the Australian Army Administration Camp and Hospital. Later additions and amenities were established, including lush stone-terraced gardens. The Germans were also joined there by Italians. <BR><BR>Compound B was later established to the east when 640 local German internees were transferred from across Australia. Following Germany' surrender in 1945, the camps were decommissioned and by 1948 all buildings had been removed.<B></B></P>\r\n<P></P>",

It was first occupied by Captain Frederick Blyth, the Commandment of the Troops. In 1858, following the 1854 Eureka uprising and the 1855 <I>Act for Better Management of the Goldfields</I>, the military forces were withdrawn from the Camp, and the house was taken over in 1859 by the Police Magistrate, Captain George Harrison. By 1862, Harrison had spent £120 on improvements, which probably included the addition of weatherboards over the slab and plaster of the original building.</P>\r\n<P>From 1865 the house was used as police quarters, occupied by Sergeant Henry Daly until 1871 and by Sergeant William Acton until 1883. The house originally had a detached kitchen (now gone), shown in 1862 sketch plans of the site, and the back verandah of the original house was later filled in to form a second kitchen and a lean-to with a flagged floor added to it, probably as a wash-house. A privy and a fowl house are shown at the rear of the block in a 1920 sketch plan. The Police Department sold the site in 1923, and it was let to Joseph Morrow, a labourer, who purchased it in 1958, and it is now owned by his son, who in c1960 subdivided the land and built a new house adjacent to the old one.</P>\r\n<P>The building was originally a five-room house with an H-shaped plan, a gabled roof and verandahs in the recesses at the back and front. The walls, of hand-adzed horizontal slabs covered with a mud render and later weatherboards, are on a base of large hand-cut stone blocks. It has twelve-paned double hung sash windows, with later metal canopies, a shingle roof, now covered with corrugated iron, two brick chimneys and rendered brick steps leading up to the front verandah. Internally the original room arrangement has been preserved except that one of the back rooms has been divided into two, and the back verandah has been enclosed by a brick wall with a central fireplace. There are fire places with timber surrounds in four of the rooms. The original rough plastered interior walls have been covered with plasterboard, probably in the 1920s. The lean-to wash-house has been removed, though the flagstones remain on the ground, and a timber-framed corrugated iron verandah has been added across the rear of the house.</P>",

It was Australia's first purpose built internment camp for housing enemy aliens and/or prisoners of war. Camp 1 was established in 1940 and was closed in 1947. The camp housed male civilian internees, first of German origin and later of Italian origin who had been resident in Australia. The camp is a superb archaeological site with most of its features such as huts, ablution blocks, kitchens, tennis courts, gardens, ponds, skittle alley, cafÈ, hall, sewerage works and security fencing easily recognised. </P>\r\n<P>The camp is significant for its association with the Australian internment policy during the Second World War. The camp was part of a wider network of internment camps, which included camps in Victoria (eg. camp 2 at Dhurringile, camp 3 and 4 at Rushworth) as well as in other Australian states (eg. Hay in New South Wales). The overall number of internment and prisoner of war camps constructed in Australia during the Second World War indicates the political and cultural ties with Britain, as additional camps would have had to be built to cater for the number of internees Australia agreed to accept from Great Britain.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The former Ballarat Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Base on the site of the present Ballarat Aerodrome, 7 km northwest of Ballarat city centre was constructed in 1940 at the outset of the Second World War as a training school for Wireless Air Gunners under the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS). The Scheme was established by the British with Canada, Australia and New Zealand to rapidly train air crews for the British Bomber Command to fight the then far superior German Air Force. Under EATS, which operated from 1939-1945, the RAAF was committed to training 28,000 aircrew over three years including navigators, wireless operators, air gunners and pilots, equating to around 900 aircrew every four weeks. To achieve this the RAAF embarked on a rapid and extensive program establishing a network of 28 EATS schools in eastern Australia by the end of 1941, each specialising in specific skill sets required of air crew members. The former Ballarat RAAF Base was Australia's No.1 Wireless Air Gunners School (WAGS), the first of three WAGS created under the Scheme and the only one in Victoria. </P>\r\n<P>By 1941, there were nearly 800 personnel on the former Ballarat RAAF Base and by the end of March 1942 a total of 1238 air men had been trained in the operation of radio equipment and guns using Avro Anson and Wackett aircraft. A radar training wing was also established at the former Ballarat RAAF Base in 1945. Basic training for wireless operators ceased in May 1945 by which time 5025 trainees has been through the school. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>In consequence of the United States declaring war on Japan in Dec 1941 a strategic alliance with Australia was formed and in 1942 the RAAF Base at Ballarat was extended to accommodate a Liberator Bomber Squadron to assist in the prosecution of the Pacific War and in the strategic defence of Australia. The US forces camped immediately south of the residential area of RAAF Base where they constructed the Liberator Air Strip for use by their B24 bombers, large planes for the long range bombing missions required in the Pacific. By 1943 there were 80 United States aircraft at the base.</P>\r\n<P>The Wireless Air Gunners School was formally disbanded in January 1946. The RAAF continued to operate the aerodrome until 1961 when it became the property of the Ballarat Council. The Ballarat Aerodrome continues to operate as a civil airport and the surviving Second World War structures on the site provide accommodation for a large number of community organisations including an aviation museum.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The extant Second World War structures associated with the WAGS are primarily 'P-Type Huts' and Bellman Hangars neither of which were originally intended to be permanent structures, having been prefabricated and erected on military sites throughout Australia in response to the sudden and urgent need for semi-permanent accommodation for service personnel and for aircraft hangars at the beginning of the Second World War. The P-Type Huts, consisting of a simple timber and corrugated iron box with a gabled roof usually with doors at each end could be easily modified as required for particular functions. By 1941, approximately 160 standard P-Type Huts had been erected on the Ballarat site in two distinct functional precincts. In the northern aerodrome precinct around fifteen huts, of which twelve survive, were arranged on the outside of a group of four Bellman hangars arranged in pairs a few metres apart. Bellman hangars had been designed in Britain immediately prior to the Second World War to provide a fast, economical solution to the need for aircraft facilities.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The surrounding P-Type Huts were used for equipment and clothing storage, maintenance and administrative functions associated with the operation of the aircraft. At the centre of the base was the administrative, domestic and teaching precinct where over 140 huts were erected in rows, singly or in combination with additional roofs to create larger buildings. They were adapted for various uses including sleeping quarters, recreation rooms and messes, lecture halls, radio huts, stores, offices, workshops and ablution blocks. Thirty four huts remain in the central precinct. These include the former Officers' and Sergeants' Messes, sleeping quarters, ablution blocks, Headquarters, the maintenance and transport depot, stores, the gymnasium and several ablution blocks.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Other remaining fabric associated with the Second World War includes an elevated water tower, the foundations of demolished P-Type Huts and other structures and in the southern part of the site, the archaeological remains of the United States Air Force camp and the 'Liberator Air Strip'. Landscape features associated with the former Ballarat RAAF Base include road layout and the playing fields and parade ground with its border of Monterey Cypress (<I>Cupressus Macrocarpa</I>) that separate the aerodrome precinct to the north from the central domestic and administrative precinct. </P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>Dandenong Drill Hall, a timber-framed, corrugated iron clad building with iron roof and trusses built c.1915, was one of about 40 timber and iron drill halls built in Victoria between 1912 and 1916. The building comprises a major hall space with a number of smaller rooms leading from the main hall including a kitchen, offices, storage room and mess rooms. The floors are of concrete in the hall and timber in the surrounding rooms. There are three small sheds at the rear of the hall and a large vehicle shed adjacent to the hall. \r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The introduction of Universal Training in 1911 by the Commonwealth Government meant that all Australian men had to receive part time military training. This decision meant that most country towns of reasonable size needed to have a drill hall. While there were already many such buildings available in Victoria, which had a long tradition of volunteer militia, nonetheless many new buildings were required immediately. The design of the new drill halls was by Commonwealth architect John Smith Murdoch, apparently developed from Queensland models and became a pattern adopted Australia-wide (Before Federation Murdoch was the Queensland government architect). The very first of these new type drill halls in Australia was constructed in Warragul, Victoria from late-1912 to 1913. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The first volunteer corps at Dandenong was a Light Horse troop in 1877. The Victorian Rangers, a volunteer body formed in 1888 had a local unit at Dandenong. Eleven Dandenong men went off to serve in the South African war in 1899. The need for a drill hall at Dandenong became urgent by 1913 as there were about 170 members of the different corps in training. In a memo dated 1 July 1913 to the Minster for Defence W. H. Irvine, Sergeant Manners MacFarlane advised that suitable land could be excised from the Government reserve known as Dandenong Park used for sports and grazing. The purchase of this land was gazetted on 11 September 1915 and the building in use by January 1916. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>In 1938 substantial additions were made to the building including an Officers' Mess, Sergeants' Mess, lecture room and cloak room. These additions were needed as Dandenong had recently become the headquarters of the new 52nd Battalion (the Gippsland Regiment) and required additional facilities, in particular mess facilities, for officers and other ranks who travelled long distances to attend functions, conferences, lectures and other activities. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The drill hall was used as a recruitment centre during both world wars. In 1947 the drill hall was allocated to 5 Infantry Battalion as a depot for the training of the Support Company. Some minor alterations took place in 1949 involving partitioning, new fireplaces and a recreation room at the rear. Additional land adjacent to the training depot was acquired in 1951 for garaging 15 vehicles. In 1957 the Drill Hall became the home of the 15th Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, a 200 strong citizen military force unit. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Dandenong drill hall also has a long history of community use and from its earliest days it was used as the venue for dances and other activities. In 1973 the Department of Army moved to a new site and in 2002 the Department of Defence disposed of the property to the City of Greater Dandenong. </P>",

In early August the <I>St. Arnaud Mercury </I>reported further progress:</P>\r\n<P><I>\"The ladies Committee in connection with the Local Soldiers Memorial Fountain held a meeting on Wednesday. A number of designs, forwarded by various firms, were considered and one submitted by Mr. Ballantyne, of Melbourne was approved.

Total amount collected at present £94\".</I></P>\r\n<P>By September of that year, Mr. Blakeley requested permission from the Borough Council for the erection of the memorial. His reasons for the site were explained by the <I>St. Arnaud</I> <I>Mercury: \"to erect the fountain at the corner of the square opposite the St. Arnaud Hotel, as</I> <I>it is thought for many reasons that would be the most suitable position. Had the fountain been a series of basins with a jet from the top, the centre of the reserve would have been the best place for it. Being a drinking fountain it was thought its purpose would be best served by placing where suggested\".</I> However, by the end of the same month the Borough Council had decided it would be placed in the centre of the reserve facing Napier Street. </P>\r\n<P>Erected in December 1903 it consisted of a bluestone base and a white granite plinth and a short Doric column and urn in polished red granite with engraved dedication, drinking fountains, and brass insignia. It was situated in the Boer Memorial Square on Market Square opposite Kinnear's St. Arnaud Hotel, with four small cannon, which was then fenced with iron 'pickets'.</P>\r\n<P>By early July 1904, after much fund-raising by the Ladies Committee, the memorial was fully paid for at a total cost of £115. About ten years later the names of the fallen were unveiled at an impressive ceremony, but no record of the ceremony has yet been found. </P>\r\n<P>Henry Emil Schultze was the first Australian to be killed in the Boer War on 24 November 1899. He was born and raised in St. Arnaud. He initially trained with the Victorian permanent artillery and then joined the Grenadier Guards in London. In October he responded to the call for arms and joined the 3rd Grenadier Guards for a active service. On 23 November he was wounded in the battle of Belmont and he died while on a hospital train to Wynberg. Both he and Private Lynch died on 25 November 1899 and were buried at Fraserberg Station (290 miles from Capetown). The local English people erected gravestones to the two men and a photo was sent to Henry's mother. Following the news of his death, a memorial fund was set up in St. Arnaud. By late 1900 a plaque had been unveiled on the wall of the State school, another on his parent's grave at the cemetery and in c. 1903-1904 his name was engraved on the Boer War Memorial, each to honour his memory.</P>\r\n<P>Private John McNally, from the St. Arnaud district and of C Company of the 5th Victorian Mounted Regiment was accidentally shot by a sentry, while on duty at an outpost on the foggy night of 2 January 1902. </P>\r\n<P>Of W.

By June the adjoining sergeant majors residence was near, complete and a start was to be made on the orderly room. Thought to derive from standard designs done under S.E.

The gunroom was relocated in the late 1870s to the rear of the old Congregational Church which served as the drill hall. Since its operation as a vinegar works, however, the gunroom has been largely altered. Each era determined a particular architectural form and style and, within these, there were differences between architects. Typically they graduated from the single room masonry hall, as survives at Warrnambool to the hall, plus ancillary rooms, down one or both sides, which provided separate officers and men's quarters. At Geelong, freestanding quarters for the sergeant-major was an extension of this principle. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Geelong also had a gunroom at the rear, separate commanding officer and non-commissioned officer en points a men's room and a reading room.

In July 1919, the Geelong Town Council decided to build a Peace Memorial Foyer to commemorate the fallen of the First World War. A Crown grant of land at the focal point of the Geelong Civic Centre in Johnstone Park was obtained at that time and an architectural competition held with the design by the Geelong architectural firm Buchan, Laird and Buchan, in conjunction with Percy E. Everett, awarded the project. The tender of 12,000 pounds by W. J. Kelly Ltd. was accepted for the work. The Mayor of Geelong, Howard Hitchcock, laid the foundation stone on 30 December 1922, with building works not completed until 1926. W.J. Kelly Ltd was assisted by other Geelong firms, Willcox Bros., J. Smith, and C. Nash and Sons. </P>\r\n<P>Two flights of smooth-cut bluestone stairs were built that led to the upper landing of the portico with a grand foyer beyond that was to lead to a large community hall at a later date but never eventuated. Granite slabs in front of the Memorial record the First World War campaigns in which Australians fought and the names of the 3,500 who enlisted from the district are inscribed in panels on the walls. Internal plastering and external rendering was executed by G. Palmer. Plumbing work was carried out by William de Freeman, and painting was done by William Thoms. Lighting effects were installed by the Melbourne Electric Supply Company, supervised by T. Brown. The total cost at completion was between 13,000 pounds and 15,000 pounds, the money raised from local contributions. </P>\r\n<P>An article by Percy Everett in 1922 provided an explanation of the overall design intentions for Johnstone Park and the reason for the location of the Memorial foyer. Everett states \"A feature of the adopted scheme was the provision for an avenue dividing the reserve into two distinct sections. One to the North to be retained as gardens, and the Southern portion reserved for future buildings, \"The Princes Boulevard\", now completed forming an east-west axis, forms a thoroughfare by which access is obtained to the present Art Gallery, a future Community Hall and Library. The design provided for a more symmetrical alignment of the old reserve. The fences were replaced by wide, neatly kerbed boundary plots, fringing the lawns which slope toward a central insular Band Pavilion. Radial paths link the various Park entrances\". The foyer was officially opened on 31st October 1926, by the Governor of Victoria, Lord Somers, and it has been maintained in good condition until the present day.</P>",

Then comes another step, which supports the real base of the monument. This consists of a solid mass of bluestone worked in rustic fashion, so as to represent a number of rocks piled together and cemented, the idea having been taken from the heaps of loose stones which our soldiers in South Africa heaped on the spot where they had buried a comrade in the battlefield. This block is 5 feet square and 2 feet 6 inches high. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Next above this is a mass of Sicilian (Carrara) marble, the front panel bearing in relief the monogram V.M.R., surmounted with a crown, and enclosed with a laurel wreath with streamers and a knot in the centre, the whole device being worked in raised marble.

These are all grey granite and have a rock face texture. The monument is surrounded by concrete and low granite blocks supporting metal tube fencing.

Ritchie, the owner of Blackwood proposed to Council the erection of a memorial in Penshurst to those who had served and fallen in the Great War. He requested to know whether any steps had been taken by the public to erect a memorial and whether they would be satisfied with his choice to have monument rather than a building, sporting facility or service. His preference was for a tower in the form of a cross containing a clock, with an inlaid bronze tablet bearing the names of the fallen soldiers of the Shire of Mount Rouse. Ritchie was prepared to accept suggestions if a public meeting were called but he was not prepared to bind himself to anything such a meeting might decide. Councillors thought that the decision would come better from Mr. Ritchie without calling a public meeting and heartily approved his choice of a fitting memorial. <BR><BR>As soon as July 1919, Mr. Ritchie forwarded a sketch of the proposed memorial and was granted permission to proceed with the work. The memorial which was constructed was that which still stands, it is not known why the original suggestion with the clock tower did not proceed. The Country Roads Board offered no objection to the erection of a memorial. By January the next year there were already complaints about people sitting on the memorial's steps. <BR><BR>The designer and builder of the memorial is not known but it may well have been supplied and constructed by the local stonemasons, the Behnke family whose yard is on the Hamilton Highway on the north side of Penshurst.

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The first moves to erect a Soldiers' War Memorial, in honour of those men and women of Camperdown and district who died on active service in the First World War, occured in 1922 when a public committee was set up to raise funds and determine an appropriate concept for the memorial. The first sketch designs for a cenotaph, in the London format, were prepared by local architect W. P. Knights in 1923 but were rejected as too costly. A statue was preferred to a more utilitarian form of commemoration and Paul Raphael Montford, an accomplished English trained sculptor and member of the Royal Academy was engaged to design and model the work on July 5th 1926. Montford's initial concept, which involved an heroic female figure, 'the Spirit of the Empire calling the Dominions to her aid in the fight she is about to enter upon', met with acclaim and Montford developed the clay model in consultation with eminent committee members including Oscar Nevett and Justice Stewart McArthur in his studio at Toorak. The following year, Montford won the commission for the exterior sculptural groups at the Shrine of Remembrance, Melbourne, to effectively set his reputation as a classical sculptor in Victoria. </P>\r\n<P>The Memorial is a dramatic, imperial monument representing Britannia, or the spirit of Empire, summoning the Dominions (the white self-governing colonies) to her aid. It draws heavily on classical imagery, depicting Britannia as a heroic warrior woman. Around the pedestal are bas-reliefs depicting scenes from the war. The text on the reliefsuse \"high diction\", that is heroic language such as \"Valour lives beyond the grave\". The message is strongly patriotic, \"Love of Country has triumphed\", a mix of nationalism and imperialism. On the reliefs are the names of the men who served in both world wars.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Montford's allegorical figure stands over a representation of the Civil Order cast down whilst the unsheathed sword in the outstretched left hand is the call to arms, 'the answer to which call is shown by the endless line of marching men surrounding the pedestal with the special panels depicting the other branches of the services engaged'. On the shield is depicted the head of Neptune, the symbol of British sea power. Inscriptions on the monument, as models of 'simplicity and brevity', are derived from selected verse of Adam Lindsay Gordon and Latin phrases from the sixth book of Virgil's Aeneid combined with the Earl of Shannon's motto, all loosely translated.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Although the small bronze panels on the stone pedestal were cast in Melbourne, the plaster model for the statue was sent to London where, after the bronze casting was prepared by A. B. Burton of Thames Ditton, Montford's work was accepted for inclusion in the Royal Academy Exhibition for 1929. Paul Montford designed the base and pedestal of the monument in Tynong granite, the same stone as was then being used for the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne, and set his impressive bronze to obliquely face both the Finlay Avenue and the centre of the town.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Camperdown War Memorial is one of Paul Montford's most distinguished works, a highly accomplished rendition of an allegorical theme in the Classic Academy tradition and one that has considerable aesthetic and intellectual merit. The statue 'Spirit of the Empire' epitomises the desire of the citizens of Camperdown to erect an original and distinctive monument to the fallen, subsequently the sacred reserve was further defined by construction of a perimeter basalt wall in 1954 as a memorial to those servicemen and women who died in the Second World War. Casualties of the Vietnam War are recorded on the east face of the monument.</P>",

Other groups include the service buildings for production of power, steam, compressed air, refrigerated water, and other services, warehousing and storage, including magazines for explosives storage, and administration and amenities buildings.</P>\r\n<P>After the war the factory continued to provide munitions for the services, supplementing that output by manufacturing for the private sector again in the 1960s. After the Vietnam war ended demand tailed off and the workforce was allowed to reduce through a natural wastage process. In 1989, with the formation of Australian Defence Industries (ADI) and subsequent restructuring, Maribyrnong was earmarked for phased closure.<B></P></B>",

However before the monument was completed another local, Trooper John J. Lawrence of the Fifth contingent, was killed in action at Schurreberg Stoek on August 23rd 1901, so the memorial was dedicated to include both men. \r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The memorial was erected by public subscription and the design and tender of the Warrnambool monumental masons and sculptors Wooles and Carpenter was accepted in March 1901. The Carrara marble statue of a Victoria Mounted Rifleman was carved in Italy and reputedly was a stylised reproduction of Private Arthur Jones' image. The supporting pedestal, in a reduced classical style, is fashioned from a base of Harcourt rusticated granite and a superstructure of imported Hill of Fare polished granite with an elaborate white marble cap serving as the base for the statue. The memorial was originally enclosed with a decorative iron railing.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Camperdown Boer War Memorial is one of the first built in honour of Australian soldiers who died in the Boer War in South Africa. The substantial stone monument is of outstanding design and craftsmanship, with the distinctive figure of the Victoria Mounted Rifleman being carved of Carrara marble in Italy and incorporating the stylised image of Private Arthur Jones. Later First World War monuments used mass-produced stereotyped figures. The evocative and heroic monument at Camperdown, by example and through publicity generated at the time, clearly influenced the subsequent aesthetic and spiritual development of war memorials in Victoria. </P>",

The estate was built to house workers employed in the munitions industry in the Maribyrnong-Footscray area, the largest concentration of defence production establishments in the whole of Australia. The munitions industry had been established in the Footscray-Maribyrnong area from the late nineteenth century with the Colonial Ammunition Factory. It expanded following Federation, and during significant periods such as the two World Wars. By the 1940s there were several thousand workers employed in the Ammunition, Explosives and Ordnance Factories, and other related industries. Particularly during the Second World War, the need for mobilising a vast civil workforce, concentrated in a small area, put extra pressures on local services, and particularly housing. In an attempt to deal with this, the Commonwealth Government purchased land just outside of Footscray for housing for munitions workers. Altogether 235 houses were constructed, of which 42% (or 98 houses) are on the Brimbank side of Duke Street. The design of the estate was in part contributed to by Melbourne University architecture students. </P>",

Two main building forms are evident. The larger are timber framed with two rows of fabricated riveted iron columns supporting a roof of corrugated asbestos cement sheeting and with perimeter walls of red brick. Timber posts carry the trusses via shear heads and three- and four-way diagonal braces, bolted through. Perimeter walls are load bearing with regular pilasters at each roof truss position. This structure supports a central gabled roof with ridge lantern and flanking skillion roof forms, stepped down from the central roof. This is expressed in the shape of the end walls. </P>\r\n<P>The all-metal stores are constructed of sectional prefabricated panels and components, evidently designed for field erection, ie. the walls are in panels of about 2 metre square, as are the doors, and the trusses and posts are welded and riveted fabricated steel in two metre long sections. These parts are all bolted together, and each single piece is of a size which could be man-handled, or transported easily. Each steel-framed panel is covered with corrugated iron, again bolted on. The multi-leaf sliding doors of both the steel and brick stores are of an aircraft hangar type, reflecting the RAAF function, but not necessarily designed to accommodate complete aircraft in this case.<BR><BR>The former rail siding branched off the main line just west of Tottenham Station providing direct transport connection to the depot. The Tottenham Yards also included several roads for shunting trains. Some surviving contemporary planting includes Cypress and Eucaluptus species.<BR><BR>The main vehicle entrance was from Ashley Street, with a security office and gatehouse opposite the Barkley Street intersection. For many years a jet aircraft was displayed on an elevated support at the entrance. The buildings are generally red brick with steel truss roofs clad in fibro-cement sheeting. Some smaller amenities buildings are timber framed and clad in either fibro-cement panels or horizontal weatherboard. More modern (c1960s &amp; 1970s) cream brick barracks and messes occupy the north west part of the site. Two Nissen/Quonset huts and a number of small timber 'N' or 'P' type timber barracks buildings area also located in this area.</P>\r\n<P>The Tottenham RAAF depot is of regional historical significance as a major part of the Second World War defence build-up which was concentrated in the inner Western Suburbs. The place has important historical associations with other Air Force facilities such as Laverton and Point Cook RAAF bases and assists in understanding the function and complex interdependence of the numerous defence and munitions supply facilities. The buildings are also of local architectural interest as distinctive examples of functional Commonwealth Department of Works design, adapted to the particular use, in this case storage and inventory control of a vast range of military supplies and equipment. The place has local social significance as a major employer in the district following the Second World War.</P>",

The Materials Research Laboratories originated in 1910 as a chemicals advisory laboratory run by a small team of three scientists, headed by Marcus Bell. Situated in the Victoria Barracks, the laboratory provided research assistance to government and industry, with particular emphasis on defence. Following a visit to defence factories overseas during the First World War, Bell and members of the newly formed Arsenal Branch were able to develop plans for a research laboratory for an Australian Arsenal. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The new research building was built on a site south of the Cordite Factory at Maribyrnong in 1922. In 1924, it became known as the Munitions Supply Laboratory, providing scientific services to government departments in a range of research areas, including chemistry, physics, metallurgy, explosives and defence, however it achieved recognition as a leader in the field of meteorology, the science of measurement. In 1936, a separate meteorology section was established to provide testing of substances of all kinds and for the calibration of instruments.<BR><BR>During the Second World War the Munitions Supply Laboratory had a vital role in Australia's defence, testing munitions, including items captured from the enemy. In the war years staff numbers peaked at 1150, a large proportion of whom were women recruited for war work in the laboratory.<BR><BR>While munitions operations were scaled down after the war, the emphasis on defence continued, with service to industry reintroduced. The name was changed to Defence Research Laboratories in 1948 and to Defence Standards Laboratories in 1953, when it became part of the new Research and Development Branch of the Department of Supply. From the late 1950s the laboratories and their equipment were modernised and extended. A number of new laboratory blocks were built, additions were made to the original buildings and a building from the Explosives Factory was remodelled for explosives and ammunition research.<BR><BR>Gradually the emphasis on defence was replaced by an expansion in services to industrial technology, which was reflected by a further name changein the 1970s, to the 'Materials Research Laboratories' . The Laboratories have assisted with variety of projects, including investigations into the failure of the King Street Bridge in 1962, early work on xerography (photocopying), environmental protection, and the restoration of the cannons jettisoned from the <I>Endeavour </I>by Captain Cook.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The site comprises of a large group of predominantly red brick buildings north of Cordite Avenue. The two storey gatehouse and control tower provides a suitable military entrance to the complex, executed in dark clinker bricks with steel hopper sash windows. The other buildings range in date from the 1920s to 1990s, with the majority dating from the Second World War. These characteristic structures are typical Commonwealth public works department architecture featuring fed face bricks in English and colonial bond, occasionally as brick veneer, with concrete lintels, occasional and sparing string courses, steel hopper sash windows and hipped and gabled corrugated iron clad roofs. Some more distinctive process-buildings to the north have been inherited from the Explosives Factory, as the Laboratories have progressively expanded to take up parts of the former Explosives Factory site, particularly to the north east. <BR><BR>The surrounding landscape contains mature exotic trees and remnants of garden beds which reflect the efforts of Defence personnel to beautify the surroundings. Trees were also used on many munitions sites a safety measures, designed to catch flying debris from potential explosions.

This planting followed the unveiling of a Roll of Honour in the nearby Modewarre State School on Empire Day, on May 24th 1918.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Overall, 31 trees were planted to honour each local soldier who had enlisted in the First World War, with another tree planted in dedication to General Birdwood, Commander of the Anzac troops, and a further tree planted in honour of Albert Jacka, formerly of Modewarre and winner of Australia's first Victoria Cross at Gallipoli. The avenue initially comprised a row of elms that were bound by a protective fence. Each soldier was identified by a brass plaque affixed to a peg adjacent to the trees. When the ground around the avenue was cultivated for weed control and as a fire break, the trees sent up \"suckers\", causing many further elms to grow instead of a single avenue. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>In the mid 1940s, the original elms (then apparently with trunks 6-8 inches in diameter) were removed and replaced with cypresses, except for tree number 33 at the Moriac end of the avenue that had been dedicated to Albert Jacka. </P>\r\n<P>Throughout the 20th century, Les and Alan Batson were responsible for the maintenance of the cypress trees. More substantial maintenance, including the pruning of large low limbs, was carried out as part of community working bees. In later years, Mr Lowndes (father of Laurie Lowndes) planted more cypresses along the Cape Otway Road towards Moriac.

An introductory paragraph reads: \"The elm-tree avenue, planted at Modewarre on June 28th 1918, in remembrance of each soldier who had enlisted in the district.\" The poem reads:</P>\r\n<P><BR>\"<EM>We will remember, when the shadows lengthen<BR>Across the home fields and the dark blue range,<BR>From this fair land, love reaches o'er the billows,<BR>To shattered shell-torn plains.</EM></P>\r\n<P><EM>When the sun rises, robed in warmth, and splendour,<BR>When spring comes back, with soft and gentle rain,<BR>Then will our hearts, with yearnings deep and tender,<BR>Be with our boys again.</EM></P>\r\n<P><EM>When these young trees, that loving hands have planted,<BR>Shall wake to life, and on their robes of green,<BR>To mourning hearts, twill breathe of Resurrection,<BR>of life from death<BR>Of futures, yet unseen.</EM></P>\r\n<P><EM>To those who wait, twill whisper consolation,<BR>For all the longings and of time the sighs,<BR>When from the carnage, and the desolation,<BR>Earth's springtime shall arise.</EM></P>\r\n<P><EM>Twill speak to youth, of loftier aspirations,<BR>To nobler thoughts, and high ideals led,<BR>That may in coming years, in rich fruition,<BR>Around their lives be shed.</EM></P>\r\n<P><EM>Then let us prize these living mute memorials,<BR>Of brave true hearts afar across the seas,<BR>Sons of the dauntless race, that faced before them,<BR>The battle and the breeze.</EM></P>\r\n<P><EM>We will remember, when the guns have thundered <BR>Their last dread notes across earth's tortured breast,<BR>And we shall see, with glad and deep thanksgiving<BR>The tempest sink to rest.</EM></P>\r\n<P><EM>When white robed peace, has shed the balm of healing,<BR>And softly soothed earth's blood, and tears away,<BR>And nations rise, from out the night of weeping,<BR>To purer, brighter, day</EM>.\"</P>\r\n<P>In Australia, commemorative trees have been planted in public spaces since the late nineteenth century. Arbor Days were held regularly in most Victorian State Schools during the late 1800s and early 1900s, and numerous trees were planted in parks in Melbourne and throughout Victoria to mark the visits of important and famous people. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>This tradition of commemorative planting was continued in 1901 when at the end of the Boer War trees were often planted for each soldier of the district who was killed in South Africa. These plantings, however, rarely consisted of more than two or three trees in each town.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>During and after the First World War avenues of honour consisting of trees lining significant streets became a popular form of commemoration. They represented a new egalitarian approach to the commemoration of soldiers where rank was not a consideration: each tree symbolises a person.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Avenues of honour are a uniquely Australian phenomenon. Australians, and in particular Victorians, embraced the idea of planting them more enthusiastically than any other country in the world. Dating from May 1916, the Eurack Avenue of Honour is the earliest known avenue of honour to be planted in Victoria. \r\n<P></P>By the time of the Second World War avenues of honour had declined in popularity as a means of commemoration. Today it is estimated that over 300 avenues of honour have been planted in Victoria to commemorate service personnel since 1901.</P>",

It was originally erected on Bridge Street but later moved to Coleman Park in Queen Street. The memorial comprises of a Tuscan column formed of stacked Pyrmont sandstone drums, standing on a low square sandstone pedestal with radiating stub walls. There are bollards on a two step plinth which are linked to the pedestal with bronze chains. The dedications are engraved in black on granite panels on each side of the pedestal. The column is surmounted by a bronze scrolled finial which contains a mounting for a light which is now missing. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Following the conclusion of the First World War there was keen debate in the Shire of Korumburra about the most fitting way to recognise and commemorate the memory of the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice during that conflict. At several meetings held during 1918 and 1919, different schemes including an Avenue of Honour, a Memorial Hall, a Hospital and a monument were all discussed. At one stage during a Council meeting in May 1919, the Shire received a deputation from the local branch of the Returned Soldiers' Sailors' and Airman's Imperial League of Australia, which asked that the decision be deferred until a referendum of ratepayers had been held. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Council decided at first to hold the referendum, however, this motion was later defeated on a technicality. Following this, Council finally decided to proceed with the construction of a monument at Korumburra, however, the debate did not end there; the first proposed site at the corner of Radovick and Commercial Streets met with strong public opposition and, after hearing a deputation of local residents, Council eventually decided agree to change the site to the intersection of Bridge and Commercial Streets. Finally, on October 14th 1922 the monument was unveiled by Brigadier General Elliott.</P>\r\n<P>The monument lists a total of 218 names of the fallen, including those who served in the Second World War.</P>",

A committee of ten comprising five men and five women was established with Cr Growse JP as Chairman, and Mr G Knight as Secretary.

    "description": "<FONT size=2>The Leongatha Avenue of Honour was initially planted in 1918 with later additions and replacements, in Yarragon Road and Wild Dog Valley Road, Leongatha. The suggestion to establish an Avenue of Honour as a memorial for the First World War was made by Mr W Watson who was a member of the Leongatha Progress Association, after a number of alternatives had been considered. The chairman of the Tree Planting Committee was Mr R. de C. Shaw. The 'Great Southern Star' reported that an initial proposal to plant the Avenue at the Recreation Reserve was abandoned as it could have been perceived as \"a parochial movement\" and so \"it was decided to plant the avenue outside the town boundary, where more interest would be taken in the demonstration by people in the surrounding districts\". \r\n<P>The planting of the Leongatha Memorial Avenue of Honour commenced on June 22nd 1918, following a ceremony led by the Hon. JE Mackey MLA, who was then Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. Mr Mackey planted the first tree, which was dedicated to General Birdwood, a predecessor of General Monash, and a total of about 250 trees were eventually planted by over 200 people from the local community who attended on that day. Mr Mackey made a stirring address and concluded that \"As long as people used the roads leading to Leongatha, the avenue of trees would remind them of the boys who had done so much for those at home\". He added that \"When each man returned he could say this is 'my' tree, and would feel proud that the people had remembered them when they were away\". </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Originally, the Avenue was in two parts and included the main section along Yarragon Road from the Butter Factory to the intersection with Horn Street, and a second section in Wild Dog Valley Road. On August 6th 1918, the Leongatha Progress Association undertook further planting of trees in Yarragon Road from the Butter Factory up to the intersection with Wild Dog Valley Road to link the two avenues. <BR><BR>The trees for the Avenue were supplied by Moss Vale nursery, while the Shire of Woorayl offered to \"defray the costs of the tree guards\" and the Shire Engineer Mr Bate, \"pegged out the land\". Commemorative plaques donated by local builder, FW Morris, were placed on each tree, which was dedicated to a local serviceman. In 1968 the plaques were removed and replaced by a single plaque on a cairn at the north east side of the intersection of Yarragon Road and Wild Dog Valley Road. The plaque on the cairn reads: <BR><BR>\"The Great War 1914 - 1918<BR>Avenue of Honour<BR>Leongatha</P>\r\n<P>The trees in the Wild Dog Valley Road north of this point and in the Yarragon Road, north-easterly of this point to Horn Street were planted on 22nd June 1918 to commemorate the men of the district who served on active service overseas during the Great War 1914 - 1918. Erected by the Council of the Shire of Woorayl 1966 to replace name plaques attached to each tree at the time of planting.\"<BR><BR>Today the avenue still has186 trees comprising of the original trees planted including: English Oaks (Quercus robur), English Elms (Ulmus procera), Chestnut-leaved Oaks (Quercus castanifolia) and AlgerianOaks (Quercus Canariensis).</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Leongatha Avenue of Honour was the second and largest to be established in the former Shire of Woorayl (the avenue at Berry's Creek was planted on the previous day) and inspired the planting of similar memorial avenues at Koorooman, Meeniyan, Nerrena and Wooreen.</P>",

The Reserve was officially opened with a gymkhana (a horse riding meet) on January 30th 1922, and followed by a ball in the Loch Mechanics Hall that evening. An inscription board marked \"In honour of those who fell in the Great War 1914-18. Given by the Residents of Loch and District\" was erected in time for the opening. Ten years later on Anzac Day 1932, Memorial Gates were unveiled to replace the inscription board. </P>\r\n<P>The Memorial Gates comprise of a large pair of central gates between two large pillars and two smaller gates on either side. They include a sunrise motif on the top and are painted green. There are bronze plaques on each of the two inner pillars that list the names 50 fallen and returned residents who served in the First World War. A small plaque at the base of one of the pillars includes the name of the manufacturer, J Robinson of Carlton.</P>\r\n<P>English Oak trees were planted in remembrance soldiers fallen in the Second World War, sometime in the post-war period. The semi formal planting of the trees along the edge of the seating area and in pairs around the edge of the oval appears to be a deliberate strategy to provide a memorial that also enhances the amenity of the Reserve. The planting of trees in pairs along the perimeter also alludes to the \"mateship\" ethos that is part of the Anzac legend. Each tree has a plaque commemorating the person to whom it is dedicated. A further tree has been planted in the north east corner of the site, which is taken from a seed from Lone Pine. A plaque beside this tree advises that it was planted by the local RSL in 1983.<BR><BR>Until the construction of the Reserve, all sports grounds in the town (with the exception of the tennis club) were hired and little could be done to improve the grounds or erect permanent facilities. This was noted in the editorial of The Loch Express on December 4th 1918 and the matter was discussed at the annual meeting of the Loch Progress Association in 1920, where it was decided to seek offers of potential sites. </P>\r\n<P>A public meeting was subsequently held in July 1920 to consider several offers including the one chosen, which was offered by Mr Henry. At the end of the meeting, it was moved \"that this meeting decide to acquire the site for a recreation reserve.\" A committee of management was subsequently appointed and set about preparing the site. Over £300 was raised in donations to contribute to the development of the reserve. In addition, the Loch Branch of the RSL gave a donation of £76 and requested that the reserve be named the \"Loch Memorial Reserve\". A public meeting was called and this name was accepted. <BR><BR>The Reserve has been further developed over the intervening years to include a brick pavilion, toilet block, tennis courts and other amenities. </P>",

At several meetings held during 1918 and 1919, different schemes including an Avenue of Honour, a Memorial Hall, a Hospital and a monument were all discussed. At one stage during a Council meeting in May, 1919, the Shire received a deputation from the local branch of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers', and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which asked that the decision be deferred until a referendum of ratepayers had been held. The Council decided at first to hold the referendum, however, this motion was later defeated on a technicality.

    "name": "Newstead Avenue of Honour",
    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Newstead Avenue of Honour, along the Pyrenees Highway, was planted in 1919 to commemorate the First World War. During the First World War approximately 180 men enlisted from the Shire of Newstead and of these thirty-four died on active service. As early as the Gallipoli campaign in 1915, Cr Edward Rowe proposed that Council assist with an honour roll to commemorate these men. While an honour roll eventually was erected in the Mechanics' Institute, the immediate post-war community felt that something was needed to commemorate the sacrifice. Rowe, President of the Welcome Home Committee, chaired a public meeting at Newstead on June 20th 1919 that decided unanimously to co-operate with the Newstead branch of the Australian Women's National (AWNL) and establish 'an Avenue of Honour to perpetuate the memory of Our Boys'.<BR><BR>Subscriptions were generous, but the site's location proved controversial. Although a majority at the June meeting favoured the Strangways Road at Newstead, the Shire judged this unacceptable because the site was on the Loddon River's flood plain. After several deputations to Council, and amidst joyful welcomes home for returning soldiers and the Peace Celebrations, the Shire put three sites to the ratepayers' vote on July 24th: Strangways Road, Castlemaine Road, and Maryborough (Joyce's Creek) Road. The ratepayers selected the latter site (now known as the Pyrenees Highway) and, at a well-attended working bee on 23 August, volunteers planted fifty-three oriental plane trees and made timber guards for each. Another working bee shortly afterwards planted thirty trees and affixed name plates (donated by the AWNL branch) to the guards.</P>\r\n<P>Brigadier General Charles Brand (1873-1961), Military Commandant of Victoria, 1919-21, who had commanded the AIF's 3rd Brigade on Gallipoli and the 4th Brigade in France, officially opened the avenue on September 18th 1919. The date was 'a memorable one', reported the <EM>Newstead Echo</EM>, in the September 24th issue, because it was 'without parallel in the long line of various events...in the township.' Other dignitaries present included D. McLeod, MLA, Shire President Cr Coutts, Edward Rowe, of the Welcome Home Committee, and returned soldiers in uniform. Among a large 'enthusiastic' crowd were relatives and friends of the soldiers being commemorated.</P>\r\n<P>In his speech, McLeod explained that the avenue 'would be a standing memorial in the future as to what our boys had done, the magnitude of the war, the courage, devotion, and determination shown by men who had never had the military training of their foe, men who had bared their breasts in the mighty struggle for right. When walking through this Avenue, let it speak of the courage and devotion shown, and when the winds sighed through the branches, let them bring back memories of those who had fallen for their cause.' The <EM>Echo's </EM>report also predicted that 'when well grown the Avenue will give an imposing effect to the road on the selected site. The trees, which look very healthy, are surrounded by guards, and a name plate...is affixed to each. Most of the guards were decorated by friends and relatives with patriotic flags, regimental colours, and in the case of fallen soldiers, with suitable emblems of mourning.'</P>\r\n<P>The Avenue was planted with a mix of Dutch Elms (<EM>Ulmus hollandica</EM>), London Plane trees (<EM>Platanus x acerifolia</EM>) andWhite Poplars (<EM>Populus alba</EM>).In time, many trees died and were replaced by elms. Seventy-six years later, on September 17th 1995, members of the Newstead community held another working bee to replace nine trees with cut-leaf planes donated by Mount Alexander Shire Council. Within five years, however, seven of these trees had also died or been removed.</P>",

It was generally agreed in the winter of 1919 that Newstead's 180 volunteers in the First War World War should be commemorated by an Avenue of Honour followed by the erection of an obelisk, in the reserve opposite the railway station, which was then a vacant allotment. When the Avenue of Honour proposal grew controversial, due to the favoured site on the Strangways Road being on the Loddon River's flood plain, several Shire Councillors preferred an obelisk because, as Cr Gibson said; 'the obelisk would remain a lasting memorial, whereas the trees would die out.' </P>\r\n<P>On October 17th 1919, a month after the opening of the avenue on the Joyce's Creek Road, a public meeting, in the Mechanics' Institute decided unanimously to erect a memorial 'in honour of the fallen soldiers of the old Newstead Shire.' Evidently there were delays because two years elapsed before the monument was completed at a cost of £400. At the same time three local men, J. Cusack, J.T. Height and D. Smith, built a 'substantial fence' around the reserve using materials supplied by T. Odgers and Co., of Castlemaine. The memorial committee's intention was to have the enclosed area planted with shrubs to form a small park or garden. <BR><BR>The monument was unveiled on November 12th 1921 by Brigadier General Sir Thomas Glasgow (l876-1955), a Queensland Senator (1919-32), who had commanded the 1st Division, AIF, in France in 1918 and was Commonwealth Minister for Defence between 1927 and 1929.

Governor Bourke had recommended that a battery be built to protect the fledgling colony in 1837. The battery was made by filling in the area with rubble and clay to form a 2.1 m high embankment that was 5.5 m wide. It had a sloped exterior wall with vertical interior stonework, and was armed with six 32 lb guns plus three other guns. Initial reports stated that the fortifications could be seen at low tide in 1855, suggesting that the original site was built in the intertidal zone. A semicircular redoubt was built sometime after 1855 on reclaimed land, with a 300 ft radius, 9 guns, and a central magazine. The battery was later matched by a similar battery at Kerferd Rd (Port Melbourne), whose combined gunfire effectively restricted access into Hobson's Bay. The redoubt is shown on Ross' 1858 plan, and nine principal gun emplacements and five secondary emplacements had been installed by 1859, and is shown in Chevaliers lithograph of Hobson's Bay of 1862.</P>\r\n<P>By 1860, Scratchley had noted that the nine 32 lb guns at the battery were useless as they were open to enfilade from the sea and had no magazine. He recommended that four new batteries be established at Point Gellibrand, including a new battery in front of the lighthouse. In 1861, 68 lb guns replaced the previous artillery, and the previous battery was upgraded using convict labour. The existing guns were then replaced in 1870 with Armstrong Guns (2 x 300 lb, 4 x 80 lb) and 2 x 68 smooth bore guns. The expansion of the defence facilities at the Heads led to the redundancy and gradual dismantling of battery defences in Hobson's Bay by the end of the 1870s. Jervois recommended in 1877 against any further batteries at Williamstown, and specified that the current batteries here and at Sandridge should be used for drilling and practice. The Lighthouse battery, along with the Right and Pier batteries were removed in the late 1880's/early 1890's, leaving Fort Gellibrand as the only battery in Hobson's Bay.</P>",

The memorial is fenced by heavy set square concrete bollards supporting heavy gauge chain between each. </P>\r\n<P>The memorial was erected in 1922 to commemorate the local men and women who volunteered for active service during the First World War. Apollo Bay had achieved one of Victoria's highest percentages for the enlistment of eligible local men in the war. Some one hundred and two men and women enlisted, eighteen paid the supreme sacrifice and were killed in combat. In 1922 Apollo Bay and district residents recognised the efforts of these volunteers by erecting and dedicating a memorial to the local volunteers. The memorial was funded through public subscription and was erected on one of the town's most prominent sites, overlooking the main street. Built by J. Wilson &amp; Co of Bendigo, the Apollo Bay Memorial depicts the lone soldier, a typical symbol of the sentiments of communities who had lost faith in heroism and had learnt to recognise the level of loss caused by war amongst ordinary volunteers. This recognition,which occurred throughout Australia, marked a turning point as the 'unknown soldier' was increasingly commemorated instead of military leaders as had previously been the traditional practice.</P>",

When the old stone bridge was being demolished, documents in a bottle were recovered from under it. These were then redeposited, together with contemporary documents within the new bridge.

The concrete walls are finished and the iron girders are now in position, and span the stream\".</P>\r\n<P>On July 31st 1919 the local paper reported the Dandenong Shire Council meeting when Cr Groves suggested that a marble tablet should be placed on Mordialloc Bridge, in memory of local fallen heroes in the great war. He was prepared to have the work done at his own expense and the offer was accepted with thanks. \"On motion of Crs Harris and Coleman, the matter of having a similar tablet placed on the bridge on the Main road at Dandenong,was left in the hands of the Centre riding members\". Beautification programs were also proposed, including street tree planting along Lonsdale Street, near the new bridge, and in the surrounding parkland.</P>\r\n<P>On Friday 29th August 1919, surrounded by a crowd of about one thousand people, the bridge was declared open by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Lawson, who stood in for Mr Robinson, Minister of Public Works, who was prevented from attending owing to a severe attack of pneumatic influenza. The ribbon was cut by the Shire President's wife Mrs Abbot and 'the Premier, Cr Abbot and Mrs Abbot then motored over the bridge amidst hearty cheers'. Cr Groves MLA then unveiled the tablet on the bridge which had been provided to perpetuate the memory of fallen heroes at the war. This was followed by a moments silence and bowed heads. Mr Calder, Chairman of the Country Roads Board was also present and spoke at the opening. Councillors from the Shires of Berwick and Ferntree Gully were also present, but apologies were received from the Shire of Cranbourne.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Flying Boat Depot is located on the Murray Valley Highway, Lake Boga. The depot operated between 1942 and November 1947 as a Care and Maintenance Unit for flying boats. Flying boats were an important component of the RAAF war effort. The Catalina aircraft, which was first produced in the US in 1939, was quickly adopted by many of the allied forces, and formed the backbone of the RAAF flying boat fleet. Although it had a low top speed for a fighting aircraft, it also had outstanding load carrying capacity and endurance and was extremely robust. It was deployed extensively in the western Pacific for bombing, reconnaissance, supply drops and rescue missions. The RAAF placed its first order for 18 PBY-5 Catalina flying boats in 1940. The first RAAF flying boat operations started in January 1942 with a raid by Catalinas from a base in Port Moresby. From April 1943 specialized RAAF Catalina squadrons, known as 'Black Cats', flew long distance night-time mine-laying missions which effectively disrupted Japanese shipping). The USAF deployed similar squadrons, also known as the 'Black Cats'.</P>\r\n<P>Following Japanese air attacks on northern Australian towns in early 1942, northern bases and the main flying boat base at Rathmines on Lake Macquarie in NSW were considered vulnerable, and the Department of Air decided to build an inland RAAF flying boat repair depot. Qantas Empire Airways had already established an emergency base at Lake Bogain anticipation of a possible threat to its Rose Bay Sydney base. This site had a number of advantages - the lake was clear of obstructions, with flat surrounds, and aircraft could take off from the lake in any direction. The site was serviced by a railway, and power was available from Swan Hill, which also had an aerodrome.</P>\r\n<P>The first personnel arrived in late June 1942. Open fronted 'grandstand' hangars, workshops and stores buildings were established on concrete aprons around a curve on the foreshore, serviced by two concrete slipways, with a central timber fuelling jetty. Moorings buoys were set up in a long arc around the lake. The concrete semi-underground radio communications building was located in a central open area in front of the hangars. A similar bunker for VHS radio transmission was located on higher ground to the southwest of the town. At first personnel were accommodated at Swan Hill, but an RAAF barracks and WAAAF quarters were established at the western end of the Lake Boga township by the end of 1942.</P>\r\n<P>The first RAAF Catalina arrived at the Lake in July, and the first repaired Catalina took off in September. The base also serviced flying boats from the Royal Netherlands East Indies Air Force and US forces. In all, 416 aircraft were serviced and repaired at the base, including Catalinas, Dorniers, Kingfishers, Short Sunderlands, Supermarine Walruses and Martin Mariners. Catalinas were the only aircraft to see service with the RAAF for the entire wartime operations, and 168 were acquired by the RAAF. After the Japanese surrender, Catalinas were used to ferry home ex-prisoners of war, as well as servicemen from Borneo, New Guinea and the islands. The Lake Boga base was closed in 1947, when the majority of buildings were removed.</P>\r\n<P>The concrete radio communications bunker and two slipways remain on the foreshore site, along with a reconstructed PBY Catalina. Elsewhere on the former base there are remains of the concrete aprons and footings from the hangars and maintenance sheds, a concrete emergency generator house and remnants of posts and earthworks from the original perimeter fence. The VHF radio communications bunker and scattered evidence of the former barracks area remain to the west of the town. A playing field now occupies the site of the parade ground.</P>",

Harry Larnach operated a grocery store at 40 Prospect Street from 1895 until just before the Second World War, combining it with the Pascoe Vale Post Office from 1914 until 1929. His son, Lieutenant Leslie Larnach, was killed on active service in France on August 10th 1918. A tree, one of over 160, was planted in his honour at Lake Reserve in November 1919. </P>\r\n<P>TheNLA's Troverecords aBrunswick and Coburg Leader article dated Friday 5 October 1917 announcing 'Tomorrow, Saturday at 3pm that the Mayor of Coburg (Cr. A. Bush) will unveil the memorial fountain in Pascoe Vale, to the soldiers in the district who have fallen.' There is another dated Friday12 October 1917 about the unveiling of the Memorial. The 'handsome drinking fountain' was unveiled Saturday (6th October 1917) by Mayor of Coburg (Cr. Alfred Bush), who 'expressed his feelings of pleasure at being invited to perform the ceremony and sorrow at its necessity'. He also congratulated the people of Pascoe Vale for 'furnishing the rest of Coburg with an example in the way of erecting a handsome and substantial memorial to those who had volunteered in the district.'</P>\r\n<P>A site was selected on the south-east corner of Pleasant and Gyles Street, just outside the Holy Trinity Church and the memorial was erected. </P>\r\n<P>The transfer of the memorial from Pleasant Street to Rogers Reserve c.1948 demonstrated the increased need of the community to commemorate its fallen after the Second World War. A plaque has also been added for the fallen of Korea, Malaya, Borneo and Vietnam. </P>\r\n<P>Rogers Reserve was named for Cr Harry Malcolmson Rogers - possibly after his untimely death (of pneumonia) in September 1933. It is one of only four memorials of this type in Victoria, the others being located in Gisborne, Mordialloc and St Kilda. </P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>HMVS Cerberus (Her Majesty's Victorian Ship) is one of the most historically important naval vesels in existence, with world-wide significance in the development of naval architecture and the conduct of naval warfare. Ordered on behalf of the people of Melbourne in 1866 and serving always within Port Phillip Bay, it was the longest-serving colonial warship. As such, the Cerberus has had closer ties with the history of Melbourne, the State of Victoria, and the Royal Australian Navy than any other vessel. </P>\r\n<P>The Cerberus was the first fully-armoured fighting ship purpose-built for service in Australia, and the first designed to operate without sails. On the journey out from England in 1870-71 it was the first fully-armoured warship to pass through the Suez Canal. In service, it was the most powerful colonial warship in Australian waters prior to the foundation of the Royal Australian Navy in 1911. Cerberus became the flagship of the Victorian Navy and in 1911, following Federation, was a foundation unit of the newly-formed Royal Australian Navy. The Cerberus history of service was such that the Royal Australian Navy named its training base on Western Port Bay, Victoria, after the ship. </P>\r\n<P>Cerberus played a key role in the numerous mock naval battles and military exercises with the shore forts near Williamstown, Queenscliff and Point Nepean. Its remains are a lasting memorial to the times when Victoria feared the threat of foreign attack or invasion in the latter half of the 19th century, and to the overall defence preparations - in which it was a key element of our integrated defences - made to counter such threats. </P>\r\n<P>During the First World War Cerberus was used as a floating shore for explosives, and was afterwards recommissioned as HMAS Platypus 11 to serve as a depot ship to the J-Class submarine fleet on Corio Bay during the 1920s. In 1924, after being sold for scrap, most of the more valuable parts were stripped from the ship. Despite this the hull, internal divisions, anchors, turrets and four guns survived. The City of Sandringham purchased the hull for a breakwater in Half Moon Bay, where it has remained for over 70 years. </P>\r\n<P>The design of the Cerberus by the eminent naval architect, E J Reed, Chief Constructor for the Royal Navy, was the prototype upon which all British battleships built between 1885 and 1905 was based. It represented a complete departure from the established tradition of wooden, high-sided warships. In an era of experimental vessels, its design was a successful development over that of its ill-fated predecessor HMS Captain, the first large-scale monitor, which capsized and sank in a storm as a result of low freeboard, tall masts and large sail area. As such, it is also a reminder of the outcome of the historic design controversy that raged between E J Reed and Captain C P Coles, inventor of the revolving gun turret and architect of HMS Captain. As the first breastwork monitor built, the Cerberus represented an important step in the evolutionary development which led to the 20th century battleship, and is now one of only two known monitor-type vessels anywhere in the world - the other being the wreck of the original Monitor which foundered off the U S coast in 1862. </P>\r\n<P>The archaeological significance of the Cerberus is high, as investigations of the remains may have the potential to answer questions and provide interpretations and education in relation to the development of warships, and the naval technology developed and in use at the time.</P>",

This work carried out by Burwood Monumental Works at a cost of £200 was unveiled on Anzac Day, April 25th 1949. Further work was carried out at a cost of £63 in May 1949 to prevent the memorial collapsing.

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Victoria Barracks is bounded by St. Kilda Road, Wadey Street, Wells Street and Coventry Street, Melbourne. The Barracks have consistently played a significant part of Australia's military history, throughout the nineteenth century and twentieth centuries. In the colonial era it accommodated the British Imperial Garrison troops, from 1901 -1958 it housed the Department of Defence and during the Second World War it became the headquarters of the Australian War Cabinet. The Victoria Barracks were also the initial Headquarters of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), on its creation in 1911; and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), from its formation in 1921. Australia's involvement in the Boer War, both World Wars and the war in Korea were planned and coordinated - by government and military staff - from the Barracks.</P>\r\n<P>Construction of the barracks began in 1851, with a second stage of works between 1856-1864, costing approximately £96,000. \"The Keep\" at the rear of G Block in the Victoria Barracks, erected in c.1860 is a stone fortification built from a design prepared in the Public Works Department. \"The Keep\" at Victoria Barracks is the sole surviving remnant of a once extensive fortified wall forming the western boundary to the barracks compound. Although the fortifications we re-erected immediately after the \"Russian Scare\" of the 1850's, the role of the keep has been symbolic rather than strategic. <BR><BR>The J\" Block of the Barracks was erected in 1860 served as the Barracks hospital and accommodated the 40th Regiment of the Imperial garrison in Victoria. This two storey regular coursed basalt structure, with restrained fine axed stone mouldings, was designed by P.W.D. architect, Gustav Joachimi, in a style based upon colonial Georgian architectural traditions and generally adopted for military barracks in the mid 19th century. The composite timber and iron verandah was erected after 1878. </P>\r\n<P>Since the Second World War, the barracks have become the headquarters 3 Division (CMF/Army Reserve), the Soldier Career Management Agency, the Defence Signals Directorate, Army Logistics Command, Headquarters 3rd Military District, Defence Centre - Melbourne, and - currently - Headquarters Support Command Australia. The Federal Cabinet has met in Victoria Barracks twice in recent years, in part to commemorate the Second World War cabinet meetings. The Keating Cabinet met in 1995 (as part of 'Australia Remembers' 1945-1995), and the Howard Cabinet in 1996.</P>",

It is also of significance internationally as part of one of very few twentieth century gunpowder manufacturing plants in the world and is probably the last such building erected for production of gunpowder for military use.<BR><BR>The mill is of historical significance for its role in munitions production during the Second World War as part of the Munitions Annexe Number 5, later Albion Explosives Factory. This was Australia's main producer of propellant and high explosives during the Second World War and remained one of the three primary military explosives and propellant factories up to the 1980s. <BR><BR>The Black Powder Mill demonstrates the technological and manufacturing processes required for meeting Australia's defence needs, and in particular the requirement for reliable powders. The edge-runner incorporating mill demonstrates the principal process in gunpowder manufacturing, which has its origin in stone mills of the 16th century and earlier and reached its peak of technological development in the second half of the nineteenth century. The plant as reflected at Albion is little changed in principal, operation or appearance from that of the 1880s. As such it is possibly the only original plant and building in Australia which can effectively convey the key process in the of gunpowder manufacture.<BR><BR>The Black Powder Mill is of social significance as the last building of the more than 700 structures that made up the Albion Explosives Factory that was pivotal in munitions supply during the Second World War. The building graphically demonstrates the dangers associated with working in the munitions and explosives industry in its design philosophy of controlled destruction and safety zones, which allowed operators to monitor the process remotely and to escape or find protection in the event of the almost inevitable explosions. The munitions industries in Melbourne's West became the largest single employment sector for several years. At the peak of production 1942-5 literally tens of thousands of workers were employed at the major explosives and ammunitions factories - Explosives Factory Maribyrnong (EFM), Ammunition Factory Footscray (AFF), Ordnance Factory Maribyrnong (OFM) and Albion Explosives Factory (AEF). Thousands of others worked in defence related industries in either private companies or the annexes, including the adjacent ICI site at Deer Park.",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The General Gordon Memorial, located on Spring Street Melbourne, commemorates the life of the General who was killed in Sudan, Africa in 1884. The memorial comprises of abronze full-length figure of General Gordon standing looking down, lost in thought. The pose is informal, arms folded, his cane (his famous 'magic wand') under his left arm, right hand to the chin and left hand firmly grasping a small bible clenched beneath his right elbow; the weight is on the right foot with the left on a broken cannon. The work is rich in detail: Gordon is wearing a crumpled army patrol jacket, belt undone, and without hat, sword or weapon; his binocular field glasses are slung on his back. Thornycroft wished to represent a military environment but also to express Gordon's dislike of bloodshed and war and Gordon's brother also wanted a representation that was 'as little military as possible'. Thornycroft, by showing Gordon with down-cast eyes perhaps avoided the problem of conveying his subject's apparently piercing gaze.</P>\r\n<P>The pedestal is stone, 5.65 metres high, and the figure, 3.30 metres high. Around the pedestal, there are four bronze bas-reliefs illustrating significant stages of Gordon's life, which is also decorated with bronze wreaths and swags. The work is surrounded by a circle of low posts supporting a link chain. The figure is signed on the base (on the side under Gordon's right foot) 'Thornycroft A.R.A.' </P>\r\n<P>Charles George Gordon was born in Woolwich (east of London) on 28 January 1833 into an Army family; he entered the Royal Military Academy in 1848 and obtained a commission in the Royal Engineers in 1852. Gordon served in the Crimea 1855-1859 when he was promoted to captain. After a year in England, he served in China 1860-1865, where his outstanding military and diplomatic achievements were rewarded by both China and Britain and he earned the nickname 'Chinese Gordon'. He then became commanding royal engineer at Gravesend for six years, superintending construction of forts for defence of the Thames. His spare time was spent working for the poor and sick of the area, taking a special interest in the infirmary and the ragged schools.</P>\r\n<P>In 1871, Gordon again went overseas and, by 1874, was appointed governor of the equatorial provinces of Central Africa, a turbulent area at that time. When his attempts to end the slave trade were frustrated, he resigned but soon was made governor-general of a larger area with some successes; however, he again resigned. In 1880, Gordon was once more invited to advise the Chinese government, followed by service in Mauritius and the Seychelles, then in Basutoland and in the Holy Land.<BR><BR>In 1884, because of turmoil in the Sudan, Gordon was commissioned to evacuate the British army from the country and establish an organised independent government. Rather than evacuate, Gordon tried to defend but, after some success, he found himself hemmed in by the Mahdi, a spiritual and temporal leader of the Muslim uprising. The British government delayed raising a rescue force with the result that the Mahdi stormed Khartoum and Gordon was killed, a few days before the relief contingent arrived.<BR><BR>The outburst of popular grief in Britain, the colonies and other countries was great. A day of national mourning was observed and special services held. The British parliament voted funds for a national monument to be placed in Trafalgar Square and commissioned Hamo Thornycroft, the statue being unveiled on 15 October 1888. Other English monuments to Gordon include one in St Paul's Cathedral, by Sir (Joseph) Edgar Boehm, a bronze bust in Westminster Abbey and a statue of Gordon on a camel at Chatham barrack square, both by Edward Onslow Ford, and a memorial in Rochester Cathedral. The Gordon Boys' Home was also founded in Gordon's honour. In Australia, New South Wales raised a contingent of troops while Melbourne erected another casting of Thornycroft's sculpture. In 1885 (the year of Gordon's death), a bust of Gordon was installed in Boort's shire hall, being part of the newly constituted shire of Gordon (this is now in the Boort Historical Museum). In 1887, a new technical institute was established in Geelong and named for Gordon. In 1891, the Bendigo Art Gallery obtained a copy of Lowes Cato Dickinson's 1885 painting, Gordon's Last Watch, the first official memorial portrait of Gordon (the Gallery sold the work in 1995). Frederick White had installed in his house, Booloominbah (now part of the University of New England), a stained glass window by Horbury Hunt that depicts the life of Gordon.<BR><BR><BR></P>",

It is the only survivor from the RAAF's wartime fleet, and the only one remaining in this country. During the Second World War, seven squadrons of the Royal Australian Air Force flew a total of nearly 300 Consolidated B-24 Liberators in defending Australia against Japanese aggressors. They were especially instrumental in deterring an invasion force of 50,000 Japanese troops assembled in Timor. Though more than 18,000 of these aircraft were built in the USA during the war, only five remain world-wide today. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>On August 15th 2000, this aircraft was dedicated as a national memorial to those who maintained and flew the Liberator during the dark days of the Second World War. The actual ceremony and all that has gone into the aircraft's restoration was the subject of an episode of the ABC TV's Australian Story three days later. Even in its incomplete state, the aircraft itself has already become a focus for veteran reunions, and is still amazingly capable of stirring personal emotions - perhaps in laying ghosts to rest - amongst many of the older visitors to the Werribee restoration site. <BR><BR>The B-24 Liberator represents the ultimate strength of the Royal Australian Air Force, which at the height of its development operated these aircraft in seven squadrons and two special flights during the war in the Pacific. It was the largest aircraft in service with the RAAF in wartime, and is the only one remaining from a fleet of nearly 300. As such it is now an historic aircraft of national significance, an icon in the history of Australia's aviation heritage and development, and a monument to our nation's military resolve to resist the might of a would-be invader. <BR><BR>The B-24 represents a notable advance in the development of aviation technology in being the first practical application of the American, Davis-designed wing. Though the design of this long tapering low-drag, high aspect ratio structure was several years old at the time, the 1939 Liberator prototype became the first production aircraft to adopt the design, around which the rest of the aircraft was built. The new wing gave a much improved performance with fewer materials used in its construction, and thus less weight overall, compared with its contemporaries. In this respect it was regarded as the forerunner of the modern aeroplane in terms of longer slimmer wings, which eventually took on the swept-wing configuration of today's large passenger jets. It also pioneered the use of tricycle undercarriages on large four-engined aircraft which eventually became the stamp of modern aircraft design, as well as testing and deploying new radar developments as they became available. This particular B-24MR Liberator (R denoting its radar applications) is the only one of its kind left in the world. It therefore has some claim to international significance. <BR><BR>Some 20,000 RAAF personnel serviced and flew these aircraft from Australian bases during the Second World War. Many more flew them as early volunteer members of Britain's Royal Air Force, not only in Bomber Command, but also in Coastal and Transport Commands. Australian veterans and others from overseas therefore spent a considerable part of their younger lives in association with this aircraft during the Second World War. More than a few actually gave their lives in the defence of this country, and in the liberation of Europe. Of the 287 RAAF Liberators on operations a total of 33 aircraft, or more than 10% of their numbers, were lost in the south-west Pacific theatre during the war, mostly as a result of enemy action. July 1945 was a particularly bad month, when 5 aircraft were lost together with 50 men. A further 170 aircrew also died in association with the other losses. As bad as it was, this total does not reflect the many other Australian airmen who gave their lives while flying B-24s in other theatres, especially those who had served with the RAF over Europe. For this reason the aircraft was dedicated as a national memorial to all these people on August 15th2000, the 55th Anniversary of the end of the war in the Pacific.</P>",

    "name": "Fort Queenscliff",
    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>Fort Queenscliff, located at the corner of King and Gellibrand Streets, was developed from 1860 onwards. The fort can best be divided into eight precincts; the Seaward Defences, Landward Defences, Telegraph Station, Stores, Barracks, Guard House, Parade Ground and Education Centre. The Fort was the first and the primary defence site for Port Phillip Bay and played a command role in relation to the other fortifications around the heads of the bay. Fort Queenscliff was a key element in making the bay the most heavily defended British port in the southern hemisphere at the time. During the twentieth century, as the strategic importance of coastal defences was revised, the Fort became a central instructional college for army officers. After more than 140 years of operation the Fort continues to play a defence role.</P>\r\n<P>The earliest development on the site was mainly to do with shipping into Port Phillip Bay. Several pilots' cottages were erected in 1841 and the following year a lighthouse was constructed. In the mid 1850s a telegraph station (used to transmit news of arriving ships to Melbourne) was built and it survives today within the fort as the second oldest such station in Victoria. A replacement lighthouse was erected in 1863 and it too survives today inside the fort, as do the keepers' quarters built at the same time. <BR><BR>Fears aroused by the Crimean War in the 1850s led to the first military development at Queenscliff. Melbourne was now a wealthy city following the gold rushes and had to be protected from potential seaborne attacks. British officer Captain (later Lieutenant Colonel) Peter Scratchley RE recommended that four forts be built near the heads of the bay, but only Queenscliff was developed at this time. In 1860 a sandstone sea wall (350mm thick) was built on Shortlands Bluff at Queenscliff, and subsequently a battery of three 68-pounder muzzle loading guns was installed above. The wall has no equivalent in Victoria and is the most substantial wall of any Scratchley fort in Australia. The guns were manned by a volunteer unit raised from the local area. There are still a dozen Gun Emplacements, dating from the late 1870s-early 1890s. These are mainly concrete and brick, with some use of bluestone, and several emplacements have bolts indicating where the guns were positioned. A restored 6-inch breech-loading gun on hydro-pneumatic mountings has been installed as well as a Nordenfeldt gun. Four restored cannon barrels have been placed outside the fort, although these emplacements are not original.<BR><BR>In the late 1870s Scratchley and Major General Sir William Jervois came to Australia to advise on defensive measures in a number of the colonies. In 1877 they recommended improvements at Queenscliff. Two years later the original battery was demolished and two new ones, an upper and a lower battery, were installed by 1882, at which time there were strong fears of Russian aggression. An enclosing wall and keep were begun in 1882 and completed in 1886. A dry moat was excavated the following year to run along the seaward southern boundary of the, at 3m deep and 5m. Also built was a 6 metre high, protective earth mound that provided shrapnel protection to personnel. The battery and the lighthouse precincts were by now enclosed together. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The telegraph station and keepers quarters were given over to the military, although the 1888 signal station and the lighthouse remained in civil use. The Victorian Artillery was moved permanently to Queenscliff from Melbourne. Alterations were made to the gun emplacements as the technology of weaponry continued to evolve. Defences were built at other points near the entrance to Port Phillip Bay, but Queenscliff was the most important and was the command centre for the system, hence the need for landward defences such as the wall, keep and ditch. By 1886 Port Phillip was regarded as the most heavily fortified port of the British Empire south of the equator. The Victorian Permanent Artillery remained until Federation when the Royal Australian Artillery staffed the defences. <BR><BR>A Directing Station, Fire Control, was built upon the earth mound 1914 to direct the firing by the fort. Then in 1915, timber barracks and mess buildings were erected. These were removed in the mid 1930s and replaced with brick buildings for the Royal Australian Artillery and the Royal Australian Engineers. In 1947 all coastal artillery was decommissioned. The previous year Fort Queenscliff had become the home to the army's Australian Staff College which it remained until 2000. During this period a number of demountable classrooms were installed, and many have since been removed. In 1982 a museum was established in the fort and tours started running for the public. Following the departure of the College, the Soldier Career Management Agency moved into part of the precinct, joining various other units. Fort Queenscliff is still owned by Defence. </P>\r\n<P></P>The Fort Queenscliff Military Historical Society now occupies the 1887 Office associated with the Electric Engine Room; it is of brick construction. The Society's Museum is in the bomb proof Electric Engine Room built into the protective earth mound, with a vaulted access tunnel.",

Fears were growing that the conflict between Russia and Great Britain was imminent. In 1887, noted authorities Sir W. Jervois and Peter Scratchley arrived to advise the colonies on a defence plan. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Battery is set on an elevated position overlooking the ocean and the settlement. The three gun emplacements are located around a central mound which was the old magazine. The ground slopes from this mound to the east and west. A semi-subterranean battery and magazine was constructed on the site in 1889. Prior to the Battery, the site was the \"observatory\" (1839), a flagstaff (1854) and a lighthouse complex (1859). The lighthouse was moved to Whalers Bluff in 1889.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>In 1885, the Ballarat Drill Hall was constructed for Defence in Victoria to a Public Works design. The drawing was prepared by S. C. Brittingham, assistant architect of the North West District, and the building erected by contractor James Taylor. The site chosen in Curtis Street was close to both the Central Business District and the railway station opened in the 1870s. S. E. Bindley had become Architect in charge of the North West District in 1884. Bindley's initials appear with those of H. R. Bastow on the original drawings for the Ballarat Drill Hall or Orderly Room. </P>\r\n<P>The Ballarat orderly room or Drill Hall is typical of timber framed buildings of the 1880s with brick chimneys and galvanised corrugated iron roof above weatherboard external walls. The drill room roof spans over twenty two metres on steel trusses and has a lantern section in the centre of its fifty five metre length. The plan form is similar to that of the smaller Bendigo orderly room except that two cottages are attached to one side of the hall, while the ancillary rooms stretch along the other side adjacent to the street. The double height front facade is divided into three levels with bands of windows joined by deep wooden string courses. Window surrounds are rectangular below the standard eaves and pitched in the gables sections of the building. The horizontal emphasis is repeated on the side facade (Lowe Street) where windows in the gabled sections are again joined with strip courses.</P>\r\n<P>The Lowe Street elevation is executed masterfully with three symmetrical gables and regular window spacings articulated by changes in roof level and window shapes where gables occur. The large gables are half-timbered with wooden pickets, while the smaller ones are fitted with a plain collar tie. The gable decoration culminates in large pointed finials with fine mouldings. In this building all the elements which are repeated in almost every later orderly room built by the Public Works Department are fully developed. The Ballarat Drill Hall is the finest example of Bindley's orderly room style.<BR></P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Former Hamilton Drill Hall, on Milton, McPherson and Francis Streets, was designed and constructed Pre - First World War, between 1901 - 1910. From 1901 to c.1910 drill halls such as Hamilton were rented or leased by the Commonwealth in each State. Between January 1910 and October 1913 drill halls were erected to standardised designs or purchased in all states. In Victoria, 12 were under construction with 3 purchased; including the Hamilton Drill Hall. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>In August 1914 the first detachment of infantry volunteers and of the Hamilton Light Horse left for training in Melbourne. From 1915 to 1917 the squadron became the 20th (Corangamite) Light Horse and in 1915 the C Company of 72nd Infantry was formed in Hamilton. The Drill Hall was not seen by the community as a centre of the war effort and the honour rolls and memorials were placed in the local hospital, the town hall and at Melville Oval. In the 1920s the squadron was known as B Squadron 4th Light Horse regiment and the Infantry unit was now A Company 21st Battalion. An iron shed at the rear of the site provided stabling for horses. The building and site were modified in 1926 and in 1928; in 1926 new fences and gates were added and in 1928 electricity was installed. <BR><BR>The impact of the Second World War was slow to reach Hamilton and the major development was the selection of Hamilton in 1940 as the site for a military training camp at the showgrounds, which is near the Drill Hall site and linked by vacant land at that time. In March 1941, the Hamilton Unit of the 9th Battalion of the Volunteer Defence Corps was formed under the charge of R. Dunkley and H.T. Austin. This was a home defence force made up largely of ex-servicemen. Fortnightly drills were held for the 140 or so members, and there were periodic manoeuvres and mock battles. The College Oval is near the site of the Hamilton Army Reserve Depot and the close proximity of the land may have been instrumental in its selection as the site of the Drill Hall. To cater for the larger numbers of troops the firing platform of the former miniature rifle range on the eastern wall of the hall was converted to a kitchen and toilets added at the north-east corner of the hall.</P>\r\n<P></P>There are only two other drill halls from this period remaining in Victoria, at Colac and Kyneton. Both these buildings are more stylistically interesting than Hamilton. The Hamilton Drill Hall is a very simple, relatively unadorned gabled design framed in timber, clad with galvanised corrugated iron. This was to be a portent of the next era of drill hall design in contrast to the more ornate Colonial drill halls of the late nineteenth century. The Hamilton Drill Hall was a precursor to the purely wood and iron drill halls that were built by the Commonwealth after 1912. The building as erected measured 74 x30 feet and was supported on concrete foundation stumps as was the stable building. The March 1914 extensions appear to have been restricted to the addition of five small offices in a skillion on the western side to replace offices formerly located in the area of the hall at one end.

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Langwarrin Camp, on the corner of Robinsons Road and McClellands Drive, was a former Colonial military camp. The camp was used by the Victorian militia from 1886. The Victorian citizen forces paraded and drilled weekly at unit level. However it was clear that the forces needed to practice in larger formations. The custom of holding an annual encampment of three days at Easter began in the volunteer era, with camps often held on the properties of interested pastoralists, such as the Chirnside's at Werribee and the Clarke's at Sunbury. After the reorganisation of the colonial forces in 1884, the camps were held at Langwarrin.</P>\r\n<P>Because the Australian role in the First World War was primarily to provide infantry as part of a larger British military force overseas, there was therefore little need for extensive military establishments in Australia for anything other than basic training and marshalling. A number of camps were established for these purposes. Camps such as Langwarrin, Broadmeadows and Seymour had some semi-permanent buildings, mainly for administration, ablutions and cooking, but the majority of accommodation was still in tents. Today there is no visible remains of military activity at the Langwarrin camp site. </P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>Planned in 1913, the HMAS Cerberus Central Area Group is one of the largest military ceremonial grounds in Australia. The form is representative of early twentieth century planning with its strict rectangular plan bisected by north-south and east-west axes which are punctuated by significant buildings. The Central Area Group consists of a group of buildings planned around a central ceremonial area with the principal building on each axis. Significant buildings include: the wardroom (151), A block (187), B block (188), C block (189), senior sailors' accommodation (190), gunroom (194), grant block (197), gunnery administration (110), drill hall (111), the gunnery school (106/108), hospital administration (161) and the Memorial Chapels (113 and 114). The parade ground, landscaping and street furniture are of note.<BR></P>\r\n<P>The buildings variously reflect the simplified Classical Revival architecture of their time. Groups of buildings achieve unity in the use of materials from red brick with terracotta tile, or timber with corrugated iron, or stone with slate and tile. Overall unity is achieved between some groups of buildings through the sympathetic use of scale, massing, detailing and (original) colours. HMAS Cerberus is historically significant in the development of the Royal Australian Navy and for its association with important Australian naval figures. Cerberus was the first, the largest and the longest serving Australian naval training establishment. Cerberus is also historically associated with the important Commonwealth architect J. S. Murdoch who was responsible for the early buildings and site planning of Cerberus.<BR></P>",

The Annual Militia Camp was staged on Beleura farm and at Mount Martha in 1938 as a precursor to a more permanent occupation for defence forces as a build-up for the Second World War. The declaration of war in 1939 meant militia training in many parts of the shire but the future Balcornbe camp was the focus from its occupation at the end of 1939 by Melbourne University Rifles and in 1940 the 4th Division arrived with military trainees. Altogether the trainees numbered around 3000 camped at Mount Martha and further inland. A special Camp Post Office was set up at the Moore Street Bay Road corner to supplement the existing office. <BR><BR>Late in 1940, the Commonwealth Government purchased 209 acres of farming land from the Henty family (Glynt) and R Ostberg (formerly Latta's Nepean Park farm and orchard) and named the site Balcombe Camp. Huts were built and the camp used for AlF reinforcement training. <BR><BR>After Pearl Harbour in 1941 and the consequent American involvement in the war, Balcombe was used as an American headquarters and for rest and rehabilitation of American servicemen in 1942.

There are afew remaining buildings from the 1940s and 1950s (mess, gym) and these appear to have been built for the school rather than the camp. Rows of sugar gums (particularly in Uralla Road) and specimen cypress are possible indicators of the camp landscape but it is more likely they were established during the school tenure. Remnants of mature plantings are sugar gums 'Agonis flexuosa', 'Angophora sp.' and some indigenous manna gum.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Tatura Prisoner of War Camp is typical of the prisoner of war camps established in Victoria during the Second World War, which consisted of 'P1' type accommodation blocks. It was established in land owned by John B. Noonan. The Camp known as \"Camp 1\" is located on the eastern side of Waranga Reservoir, 20 kms south of Tatura. It was Australia's first purpose built internment camp for housing enemy aliens and or prisoners of war. Camp 1 was established in 1940 and was closed in 1947. The camp housed male civilian internees, first of German origin and later of Italian origin who had been resident in Australia. The camp retains most of its features including huts, ablution blocks, kitchens, tennis courts, gardens, ponds, skittle alley, cafe hall, sewerage works and security fencing easily recognised.</P>\r\n<P>Camp 1 became the Chief Army Administration Camp. The camp eventually housed the hospital and dental headquarters for all camps of the Tatura group. The first internees to come to the camp were 63 Germans who walked to the camp on 25th January 1940 from Dhurringile, which had served as internment accommodation first. </P>\r\n<P>The internees were housed in army huts. At the beginning, there were 14 huts, with 16 men to each hut, in Camp 1 Compound A. Later 8 further huts were erected and 2 bath-tubs put in for 250 men. The huts were unlined. One room was converted into an orderly room and canteen, another into temporary camp hospital also mess halls, open shower rooms, open wash house and latrine. By 1943 conditions improved, the latrines and ablutions connected to a sewerage plant and sanitation provided. </P>\r\n<P>Compounds A and B were separated by barbed wire. Compound B was established in the eastern side when 640 local German internees were brought to Camp 1 from every part of Australia. Camp 1 was unofficially called the \"Nazi Camp\" and authorities who were convinced of the \"dangerousness\" of an internee sent them to Tatura. When Italy joined Germany in the war against Britain in June 1940, 22 Australian Italian internees were also brought to Camp 1.</P>\r\n<P>The Camp Commandant was in charge of the overall operation of the camp with delegated duties to army personnel. The guards at Camp 1 were generally returned First World War servicemen who had re-enlisted. The internee compounds were democratically run. Internees were responsible for their compound and managed their own administration. The compound administration furthermore included Secretariat, Arrangements Service, Orderlies, Post, Gardens, Hygiene, Canteen, Finance and Selling, Kitchen, Messes, Welfare, Hospital, Sport, Culture, Music, Library, Workshops, Exhibition, Cinema and School Halls.</P>\r\n<P>The CafÈ Wellblech was one of the strangest episodes in the camp's history. Originally it had been an army hut, used for storage. The Germans obtained permission to convert it to a cafÈ, built a four feet high stonework promenade around the front entrance, openingit early in 1942. Large tubs containing foliage and plants were placed on the promenade and tables and chairs. On summer nights an area was reserved for the orchestra. Waiters, smartly dressed, served black coffee and German cakes. Inside, the panelled walls of the cafÈ bore scenes of the Rhine valley and Berlin. Behind the counter shelves were heavily stocked with preserved foods and delicacies. In front of the counter were tables and chairs to accommodate some 30 diners.</P>\r\n<P>In 1944, the Australian authorities sounded the alarm for the camp's first escape, with other escapes following. The Welblech CafÈ was not suggested to be the headquarters for the escape society, but there was evidence to indicate it was a clearing-house for illegally gained currency notes. The chief function of the escape society was to accumulate currency notes for careful distribution to genuine potential escapees. The Welblech CafÈ was raided twice, but only at the second raid a member of the search party pulled a large almost loose nail partly from the flooring. The search party saw a small, square foot section apparently of solid concrete bordering the open fire-place slowly swing downwards, as though on a hinge. In the six-inch deep cavity revealed were a number of small compartments, empty. On further examination it was revealed that this small cellar, below floor level was completely enclosed by the chimneys foundation.</P>\r\n<P>The internees were occupied with various tasks, including gardening, providing services such as cleaning clothes and washing, with firewood cutting and gathering, road making at the camp, drainage work or general maintenance at the camp. The internees were paid for the work they completed. Probably one of the main problems in the camp was boredom. To distract the internees, two tennis courts, a skittle alley, a small pavilion with a flat roof for sunbaking andtwo hobby workshops were eventually built. Leisure activities at the camp included exhibitions, library, regular picture shows and sporting festival. The German internees at camp even published a little pro-Nazi fortnightly newspaper called Brennessel (stinging nettle), begun in 1941.</P>\r\n<P>The camp was wound up after the Second World War. In August 1946 there were orders issued to concentrate all internees held at Camp 1 into one compound and transfer the Officers to another Camp. The final closure seems to have occurred between 1946 and 1947. By May 1947, the garrison at No. 1 camp was reduced to two men. At the end of the year twelve of the huts were sold to district returned soldiers. Other huts were purchased by firms and businesses or were acquired by the Forestry Commission.</P>\r\n<P></P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The St Kilda East Orderly Room and detached residence, at 10 Chapel Street,was built in 1889. Itreplaced the original volunteer orderly room of 1865 which had been designed by Reed and Barnes. Sometime following 1889 the gabled southern wing was added, outbuildings were also built and in 1912 lean to additions were added to the rear of the main hall. In 1934, the Gun Park and Battery Stores building along the Alma Park boundary were completed.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The early defence of the colony of Victoria relied on local volunteers and the St Kilda Volunteer Rifle Corps and St Kilda Company of the Royal Victorian Volunteer Artillery Regiment were both established in 1859. After the Colonial Government took over ownership and management of existing volunteer orderly rooms in 1884 in response to a possible threat from Russia, new halls were constructed to replace those erected by volunteer units.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>As with all orderly rooms built at this time, the St Kilda buildings are of weatherboard construction with corrugated iron roofs. Porches, gables, window surrounds and the massing of the structure provides the visual interest to what are otherwise large, plain buildings. Unlike the other orderly rooms built in the 1880s, with the exception of Carlton (1888), St Kilda has metal roof trusses allowing a wider roof span and hence hall width. The original side wings are slightly different to each other, avoiding a monotonous rigid symmetry. </P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Byaduk Avenue of Honour has had two separate plantings of living memorials.The first plantings were undertaken in 1918, immediately after the end of the First World War. Forty Grevillia robusta (Silky oak) were planted from the intersection of the Hamilton - Port Fairy Road stretching west along the Penshurst Road to the old mill bridge. The total cost for the trees, guards and memorial plaques in 1918 was twenty six pounds.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>A manuscript held by the Mechanic's Institute, attributed to the head teacher, Mr J V Danahar describes how all of the residents of Byaduk attended the tree planting. The school children, under the leadership of their teacher, Mr A Paul, rendered patriotic selections. Councillor D Fraser opened the ceremony and planted the first tree, that in honour of this brother, the late Lieut S Fraser. A relative or a friend then planted a tree in honour of each of the remaining thirty - nine soldiers\". At the time the manuscript was written (1922) he stated that \"all of the trees are growing, and are now about eight feet high. On each guard, there is a white enamelled name plate bearing in black letters the name and rank of the soldier and the name of the country in which he fought. To the name plates of the heroes who fell a black cross had been added\".</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>These trees stood as a living memorial to the forty men who served in the First World War. The use of silky oak as a memorial planting is unusual, and certainly uncommon in Victoria. It is not known why this species of tree was chosen, rather than the more traditional choices of Cypress, Plan, Oak or Elm. No other memorial plantings have used this species in the Shire of Southern Grampians. The original planting of Silky oaks were removed in 1963. This may have been due to poor condition and senescence as this species tends to be short lived and difficult to maintain well in this area.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>A tablet of grey granite on a concrete base was erected between 1957-8 to replace the cast-iron name plates at the foot of each tree as they had been badly vandalised. This tablet was designed by Holden of Holden and Grambau, Ballarat Road, Hamilton.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>A decision was made to replant the avenue with Fraxinus angustifolia (Claret Ash), and the current avenue was planted on the 4th of July 1963.

About 8600 died or were killed while incarcerated. <BR><BR>The Australian Ex-Prisoners of War Memorial was conceived and designed by sculptor, Peter Blizzard. At the heart of the monument is a stark, 130 metre long, highly polished black granite wall, engraved with the names of all Australian prisoners of war. The names on this 'honour roll' are listed in historical order from the Boer War in 1899, through to the Korean War in 1953 (there were no Australian prisoners of war in the Vietnam War). It is a testament to the sacrifice made by so many Australians.<BR><BR>Standing sentinel at the centre of the Memorial are six huge basalt obelisks, etched with the names of all the countries where Australians were held prisoner of war. The obelisks stand in a large reflective pool, set back from the central pathway, symbolising the distance that separated Australia's prisoners of war from their homes and their loved ones. Opposite the pool is a larger obelisk flanked by flagpoles and a ceremonial stone on which to lay wreaths.<BR><BR>The central pathway is itself symbolic, with each of the paving stones cut in the shape of a railway sleeper. The pathway defines 'the journey' taken by the prisoners of war and the journey visitors take around the monument.<BR><BR>At the end of the granite wall where the pathway ends, visitors face a large stone engraved simply 'Lest We Forget'. Water flows from beneath the stone, along the base of the granite wall and into the reflection pool in which the obelisks stand. This cycle of flowing water, symbolising spirituality, healing, cleansing, birth and rebirth, guides visitors on their journey through the Memorial.<BR><BR></P>",

The memorial is a marble statue of a First World War Digger on a granite pillar and granite base, withfour granite wings on a circular flagstone base. The Digger stands easy holding a rifle, faces west and is supported by a representation of a tree trunk. There is a flagpole on the north side. The entrance gates to the park form part of the memorial and are inscribed with \"1914-18 Dedicated To The Memory of Cpt. Albert Jacka V.C.

He landed at Anzac Cove on 26 April 1915. At 3am on 19 May, the Turkish forces attacked just about the entire front line above Anzac Cove. The Australians replled the Turks, except at Courtney's Post, where the ground favoured the Turks. At about 4am, the Turkish soldiers entered part of Courtney's trenches, forcing the Anzacs to withdraw. The Turkish soldiers wwere blocked to the south by soldiers of the 14th Battalion, and to the north by Lance Corporal Albert Jacka, 22. Lieutentant Keith Crabbe asked Jacka if he could retake the trench. The attempt he made failed, and resulted in two of the three men who joined Jacka being injured in the counter-attack. A second attempt was made, with Crabbe creating a diversion while Jacka worked his way around the Turks' flank.</P>\r\n<P>Jacka entered the trenchm shot five men and bayoneted two others. Jacka's first words to Crabbe were, \"I managed to get the beggars, sir\" (Bean 1941). It was for this action that he was awarded the Victoria Cross and became a national hero. John Wren gave him a gold watch and £500, and he featured on recruiting posters and magazine covers.</P>\r\n<P>After being commissioned as second lieutenant in early 1916, Jacka and the 14th Battalion were at Pozieres in August. He he was awarded the Military Cross at Bullecourt on 8 April 1917 when he led a night reconnaisance party into no-man's-land to inspect enemy defences before an Allied attack against the new German line. He penetrated the wire at two places, reported back, then went out again to supervise the laying of tapes to guide the infantry. The work was virtually finished when two Germans loomed up. Realising that they would see the tapes, Jacka knew that they must be captured. He pulled his pistol; it misfired, so he rushed on and captured them by hand.</P>\r\n<P>A few months later, at Messines, he led his company in capturing a field gun. In Polygon Wood, Jacka was praised for his role in rallying the troops. In May 1918, he was badly gassed and evacuated ot England. A member of the 14th Battalion wrote:</P>\r\n<P>He deserved the Victoria Cross as thoroughly at Pozieres, Bullecourt and at Ypres as at Gallipoli...The whole AIF came to look on him as a rock of strength that never failed. We of the 14th Battalion never ceased to be thrilled when we heard of ourselves referred to...by passing units on the march as \"some of Jacka's mob.\" (Rule 1999)</P>\r\n<P>A large crowd, including the Governor General, greeted his ship whe it berthed at Melbourne in 1919, and a convoy of eighty-five cars with Jacka at its head drove to the town hall where men from the 14th Battalion welcomed their famous comrade. He was demobilised in January 1920.</P>",

Following cessation of hostilities in 1919 and completion of the plantings of the Ballarat Avenue of Honour, the 'Lucas Girls' (from the clothing firm, E. Lucas &amp; Co, Ballarat) led by Mrs W. D. Thompson, began planning and fund raising of £2600 for a commemorative arch to provide an entrance to the Avenue of Honour.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Arch of Victory, designed by H.H. Smith, Head of the Art School at the School of Mines Ballarat, was a grand cement rendered masonry structure of a single central arch flanked by wide piers (20 metres in width, spanning the roadway, and 18 metres high). The arch, erected in 1920, is crowned by the 'Rising Sun' symbol of the Australian Commonwealth Military Forces beneath which the words Avenue of Honour and Victory are written prominently across the arch. In addition to the initial costs, for the Avenue of Honour and the Arch of Victory, a further £400 was donated by the public to a Maintenance Fund, with a returned soldier employed to attend to the trees. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Arch of Victory remains intact but with the addition of memorial plaques in 1954 and 1987 to commemorate those who served from 1939-1945 and in the more recent conflicts in Korea, Borneo, Malaya and Vietnam. In 1993 the Arch of Victory Precinct, opened by Edward 'Weary' Dunlop, was created by the relocation of the 1938 Memorial Rotunda and Roll of Honour to the road reserve immediately south of the Arch. Adjacent is the Memorial Wall, with 72 bronze plaques which record the Servicemen's names and the number of the tree in the avenue that is specifically dedicated in their honour.</P>",

The gates consist of four granite pillars arranged symmetrically with two on either side of the driveway. All pillars are identical in design with a chamfered plinth and pyramid capital. The inner pillars are approximately 2.5m high and the outer pillars 1.5m. The larger inner pillars are inscribed with raised lead lettering that liststwenty local enlistees on one and on the other: 'The Great War 1914-1918, erected by the residents of Boolarra and District in memory of our fallen heroes'. </P>\r\n<P>Within the reserve itself are other mature exotic trees including Planes and Pines. Most of the buildings appear to date from the post-war period. There is what appears to be a former Nissen hut, which is a corrugated-iron clad building, semi-circular in shape. This building was added after 1975.<BR></P>\r\n<P>The decision to create a memorial park to honour the fallen was first discussed at the Boolarra Fallen Soldiers Memorial Fund meeting held on 28th November 1920.A suggestion was made by Mr P. Crutchfield that a piece of land suitable for recreation purposes be purchased and a fitting archway or entrance to the ground be erected. The matter was discussed further at a public meeting on 4th December 1920 where it was decided that a Memorial Park only, with some suitable form of commemoration to the fallen soldiers, be purchased. An executive committee was formed, which inspected and then reported about suitable sites. It was eventually decided to purchase land known as the race course, which was then owned by Mrs. Mulrooney.<BR><BR>Planning for and preparation of the reserve continued throughout the early 1920s while fund-raising was carried out. Once the reserve had been purchased a nine-member Committee of Management was appointed in 1921, which was charged with the task of selecting a design for a Memorial gateway to the park at a cost that was not to exceed 450. By June 1922, Mr Latter of the Committee was able to report that over 1,100 had been raised, and that 790 had been spent on the cost of acquiring the park reserve and carrying out improvements. However, Mr Latter regretted that the Memorial had not been erected at that time because of the difficulty in obtaining a suitable design. However, a design by Mr F. Hallett was subsequently accepted on 25th November, 1922 and he was requested to commence work as soon as possible. The estimated cost was £300.</P>\r\n<P>The unveiling ceremony of the Boolarra Soldiers' Memorial took place on Friday 15th November, 1924. The memorial comprised the 'handsome memorial gates' comprising four grey granite posts and wrought iron gates at the entrance to the park, and the park itself including a 'good race course', football oval and turf wickets. Among those present were Messrs. Thomas Patterson M.H.R., W. West M.L.A., Cr. D.J. White (President of Morwell Shire) and Mr. George H. Wise (ex-assistant Minister of Defence). Mr Latter, speaking on behalf of the Committee, invited Mr Wise to unveil the gateway. In his address Mr Wise said that he trusted that the memorial would remind present and future generations of the great sacrifices that had been made and noble deeds accomplished by the men who had fallen for their country.<BR><BR><BR></P>",

From November 1943 to November 1945, Italian prisoners of war were based at Bete Bolong, cultivating maize, peas, beans and other vegetables on local farms. Unlike other 'farming' prisoners of war, those at Bete Bolong did not live with the farming families, but at a Prisoner of War Control Centre on Crown land overlooking the Snowy River Flats. About fifty Italian prisoners lived at the centre, along with an Australian Military Force staff of approximately seven people. The prisoners were driven to and from the farms each day. Three of them apparently simply swam across the river to work. They worked a six day week, with Sundays off. <BR><BR>Although they were provided with rations, both prisoners and staff maintained vegetable and flower gardens. They were also skilled at cooking 'anything' they could catch, and at making illegal grappa. <BR><BR>Very few of the Italians were experienced farm workers. Some of them used their skills to make things for the families they worked for; a cabinet-maker made furniture , a cobbler made shoes, etc. They interacted with the local community and, although they were not supposed to go within one kilometre of town, some were found at local dances on Saturday nights.<BR><BR>As recreation the prisoners were allowed to walk along the road to the west of the camp. Local people from both sides of the river could hear them sing as they walked. The prisoners also helped to construct an 'ant bed' tennis court on a property adjacent to the centre. Although now overgrown, the site of the tennis court can still be discerned as a flat area above the site of the centre.<BR><BR>Prisoner of war camps tended to be far more substantial than those that had housed unemployed labour in the 1930s, or even 'friendly aliens' in the early years of the Second World War. The Geneva Convention specified certain conditions for prisoner of war accommodation, so huts were provided, rather than tents. Two of the dormitories that housed the Bete Belong prisoners of war are still standing in the local area. One was sold to a local farmer and used as a hay shed, and another was used for some time as a local dance hall.<BR><BR>",

Hall's design won a competition and he supervised the construction. The area was further developed and landscaped after the Second World War to include the fallen of that war. The bronze plaques, which were not part of the original contract, were sculpted by Wallace Anderson and cast in Melbourne.</P>\r\n<P>The significance of the Cenotaph includes the central structure and extends to all the hard surfaces, flagpoles, retaining walls and plantings. A structure with deliberately simple detailing, in the conventional Classical idiom, the Cenotaph harks back to the funerary monuments of the empires of ancient Greece and Rome. The symbolism is extended by the use of axial planting into the surrounding park. Materials employed are as follows; walls: ashlar sandstone; dressing: sandstone; and plinth: dressed bluestone. </P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>The Cheltenham Avenue of Honour was planted on July 28th 1917 to commemorate those who served in the First World War. The idea for the avenue was initiated by G. Livesley of the Cheltenham Progress Association in June 1917. The original plan was to plant 120 trees from Centre Dandenong Road down Point Nepean Road towards Mentone. It was also decided the Avenue would feature native trees with a timber guard and brass plate with the name of the volunteer. Money for the Avenue was raised through public subscription with each tree costing ten shillings and six pence. \r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The fundraising was successful receiving enough money for 142 trees. It was then debated at length in what order the trees would be planted, some suggested it should start with those who enlisted first. Following that reasoning, the first tree to be planted at the ceremony was dedicated to A. Fisher. However, a week later it was discovered that J. Warburton was in fact the first district serviceman to enlist.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>At the opening ceremony of the Avenue \"God Save the King\" was played and then followed by C. H. Fairbank, the president of the Progress Association introducing O.R. Snowball, a local politician and member of the Legislative Assembly of the Victorian Parliament. Fairbank praised the avenue of honour and also urged parents to allow their sons to enlist.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Snowball then planted the first tree on the corner of Centre Dandenong and Point Nepean roads attaching the name of A. Fisher to the tree guard. Six weeks after the ceremony Livesley wrote to the <I>Moorabbin News</I> to report that 199 trees had been planted, including nine trees without name plates to leave room for future volunteers.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Since 1917, Point Nepean Road has been reconstructed several times, transforming from a two lane road to an eight lane highway. Today there is no physical evidence that the Avenue existed. However the names of the men who served are recorded on the two memorial broken columns in the memorial garden behind the RSL Club Rooms in Centre Dandenong Road.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>In Australia, commemorative trees have been planted in public spaces since the late nineteenth century.

The classic elegy \"Lest we Forget\" links this memorial, which has little of the classic symbolism, to the broad tradition of commemoration of war dead.</P>",

The kurrajongs were planted in Comyn Street and are looked after by the residents of that street who also donated the trees. A further 28 trees were planted the following year. A postcard postmarked 1903 shows the avenue of young trees in tree guards along Comyn Street.</P>\r\n<P>The avenue of 49 Kurrajongs planted in 1901-02 is located along Comyn Street between the Wimmera Highway and McDonald Street. There are 28 trees along the north side and 21 trees along the south side. A tree measured on the north side, at the intersection of McDonald Street has a trunk circumference (1.4m above ground level) of 1.92m, height 11m and canopy spread 13m. The trunk circumference ranges in size from 1.09m to 1.92m. </P>\r\n<P><BR>Most of the trees are in good condition, exhibiting single trunks and spreading crowns. Some trees on the northern side in the western half have been subjected to powerline clearance. The construction of aerial bundle cables has now reduced the need for severe pruning, except to four trees at the western end where the powerlines are still mounted on cross-arms. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Kurrajong avenue is historically significant as being the earliest known Kurrajong planting in Victoria, and being amongst the earliest surviving street tree plantings using an Australian native species.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>In Australia, commemorative trees have been planted in public spaces since the late nineteenth century. Arbor Days were held regularly in most Victorian State Schools during the late 1800s and early 1900s, and numerous trees were planted in parks in Melbourne and throughout Victoria to mark the visits of important and famous people. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>This tradition of commemorative planting was continued in 1901 when at the end of the Boer War trees were often planted for each soldier of the district who was killed in South Africa. These plantings, however, rarely consisted of more than two or three trees in each town.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>During and after the First World War avenues of honour consisting of trees lining significant streets became a popular form of commemoration.

Dating from May 1916, the Eurack Avenue of Honour is the earliest known avenue of honour to be planted in Victoria. \r\n<P></P>By the time of the Second World War avenues of honour had declined in popularity as a means of commemoration.

    "description": "<FONT size=2><P>The Wilsons Promontory Tidal River Memorial Pillar was erected to commemorate the birthplace of the Commando in Australia and in memory of all those Commandos who made the supreme sacrifice in the Second World War. It was dedicated on 16 November 1964 by the Lieutenant Governor of Victoria Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring and raised under the auspices of the Commando Association (Victoria), by Australian commandos. The restored memorial was rededicated by the Premier of Victoria, John Brumby, on 18 November 2007.</P>\r\n<P>Military Mission 104, led by Lieutenant Colonel J.C. Mawhood, arrived in November 1940 with the idea of raising and training British style 'special' or 'commando' units, which had proved successful in operating against German-occupied Europe. The Australian Army decided to raise four 'independent' companies and train them at the innocuously named No. 7 Infantry Training Centre at Wilson's Promontory, a national park since 1898. It was an isolated area of high, rugged and heavily timbered mountains, precipitous valleys, swiftly running streams, and swamps, sand dunes, thick scrub, bays and cliffs.</P>\r\n<P>From 1941 to 1942 there were two camps at Wilson's Promontory. No.1 Camp was in two sections at Darby River adjacent to the present day Lilly Pilly car park. A chalet for visitors had been built south of the Darby River bridge in the 1930s after the road was constructed, and this served as the campsite for officers. When fully established, the section north of the river had floored tents to sleep thirty-five NCOs and sergeants, forty-six corporals and sixty-two other ranks. Both camps had mess huts, lecture huts, ablutions, latrines, a combined kitchen, six bed camp dressing station, a signals workshop and explosives store. No.2 Camp was at Tidal River camping River:</P>\r\n<P><EM>\"All that was there as we approached the Prom on the right hand side was an administration hut, a cook house and the showers and mess hall. This was virtually all there was there. On the left hand side was virgin scrub and they said, 'Dump all your kit bags here', and within half and hour you were covered in sand. 'Well there's your camp area; there's your tents. You go over and bash the scrub down and pitch your own tents.\" </EM>(Harry Levey, 2/5th Independent Company, quoted in Pirie 1996).</P>\r\n<P>The Prom was \"ideally suited for training troops who might fight anywhere from the Libyan deserts to the jungles of New Guinea, the only drawback being that in winter...the climate was often more polar than tropical\", as Captain Freddie Spencer Chapman, instructor in fieldcraft, wrote later. He wrote that in the beginning:</P>\r\n<P>\"<EM>We talked vaguely of guerilla and irregular warfare, of special and para-military operations, stay-behind parties, resistance movements, sabotage and icendiarism, and darkly, and still more vaguely of 'agents'; but the exact role of the...Independent Companies had never been made clear</EM>.\" (Chapman 1948)</P>\r\n<P>The role of the Independent Companies would be:</P>\r\n<P>\"<EM>to stay behind, live off the country or be provisioned from the air, and be a thorn in the flesh of the occupying enemy, emerging in true guerrilla style to attack vital points and then disappear again into the jungle. We also visualised long range penetration of the enemy lines by parties highly skilled in fieldcraft and living off the country that they could attack their targets and get back without getting detected</EM>.\" (Chapman 1948)</P>\r\n<P>The first three companies had completed their training by the second half of 1941. Initially destined for the Middle East, with the Japanese threat growing, they were deployed in the islands to the north. The 2/1st Independent Company (sometimes just known as the 1st) was sent in sections to Manus, New Ireland, the Solomons and New Hebrides. The 2/2nd was sent to Timor, and the 2/3rd to New Caledonia.</P>\r\n<P>The 1st to 8th Independent Companies, the colour patches of which appear here and on two New Zealand Units, were formed and trained in the Darby and Tidal River areas. Subsequently, Commando Training was continued thereafter at Canungra, Fraser Island and elsewhere in northern Queensland and Garden Island, Western Australia. </P>",

The Reserve was originally part of the Parliament House grounds, but it became detached from these in 1863 and was called Carpentaria Place.<BR><BR>In 1889 the Statue of Gordon of Khartoum was placed on the apex of the triangle at Macarthur and Spring Streets facing towards the Treasury Reserve. General Charles Gordon (1833-1885) was killed at Khartoum, in the Sudan in January 1885. Gordon was an important figure in imperial history and his exploits in China and the Sudan were the stuff of legend before his death. A memorial was suggested and funds were raised by public subscription. The Statue is a copy of Hamo Thorneycroft's statue that had been originally destined for Trafalgar Square. The base and pedestal on the Melbourne statue differs significantly from that in London with scenes from Gordon's life rather than representations of Fortitude and Faith and Charity and Justice. The Gordon Statue is one of the first statues erected of a public figure in Melbourne (preceded by Burke and Wills in 1865 and Redmond Barry in 1887). Gordon's memorial marked the beginning of the 'heroic age of colonial statuary' with another 11 monuments being erected in Melbourne in the next twenty years.<BR><BR>The five Canary Island date palm trees that can now be found at the site were planted in the early 20th Century when the plantings were rationalised and the link fences were installed that delineate the site and cordon off the General Gordon Memorial. As a consequence the site has retained its Edwardian flavour with its mixture of memorials and greenery. The site was not renamed the Gordon Reserve until the 1960s.<B><B>",

    "name": "Hamilton Avenue of Honour",
    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Hamilton Avenue of Honour, on Clarke Street, was planted by the children of the Elementary School on Arbour Day 1917. The idea for this memorial avenue was first presented to the Elementary School Committee by Mr Hughan, the Curator of the Hamilton Gardens. The suggestion was unanimously approved, and after the Borough Council had given its approval to both the site along the banks of the Grange Burn, and to the use of the name 'Anzac Avenue', planning proceeded. At this time, there were already 25 former pupils of the school who had lost their lives serving their country during the First World War. Twenty-six of Hamilton's men came from Clarke Street,this represented the highest enlisted/resident ratio in the Commonwealth.</P>\r\n<P><BR>The School Committee invited the Mayoress, the wife of the President of the Shire of Dundas and representatives of the bereaved relatives to participate in the Arbour day ceremony, and the Mayor and members of the Ministers' Association and the Roman Catholic Church to deliver addresses. Anzac Avenue was proposed to follow the Grange Burn from Skene Street to the railway bridge. Mr Hughan supervised on the first occasion when the nucleus of the avenue was formed by the planting of 36 trees. In 1918 the number was increased to 93. During the summer months, the boys from the School watered the trees, and the Borough of Hamilton minutes of February, 1921 record that they had carried 600 buckets of water to Anzac Avenue, for which they received a vote of thanks from the Councillors. During the next few years many of the trees in the avenue had to be replaced, as the original plane trees were not suited to the heavy soil. <BR><BR>Over the years the surviving trees grew to maturity and formed the avenue envisaged by Mr Hughan. Gradually, the significance of the trees was forgotten, so that by the latter part of the century, very few residents in Hamilton were aware of their existence. Members of the Hamilton History Centre, while researching war memorials in the town, stumbled upon information about the Avenue in Mr Sidney Officer's unpublished manuscript Hamilton Spectator 1910-1918: \"A Record of the Part it Played in the Great War with Honour Roll.\" Immediate steps were taken to determine if the plans of the Avenue survived, and if anything remained of the Avenue trees. </P>\r\n<P>Trees were found to be growing in two rows, following along the banks of the Grange Burn, from the southern end of Kennedy street westwards towards Portland Road. Most of the trees are barely discernible as the vicinity is overgrown with elm tree suckers and blackberries. The future of Anzac Avenue is uncertain. The area is now one of the few remaining habitats for the endangered Eastern Barred Bandicoot, and a restoration of the avenue will destroy the vegetation necessary for the preservation of this scarce marsupial.</P>\r\n<P>In Australia, commemorative trees have been planted in public spaces since the late nineteenth century.

    "name": "Buchan South Avenue of Honour",
    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Buchan South Avenue of Honour commemorates the veterans of Buchan and district who fought in World War 1. It is located in the village of Buchan South about 8km south of Buchan. The Avenue consists of two rows of English Oaks (Quercus Robur) planted in 1920. It formed the entrance to the Buchan South Public School (No. 3256) which was located on the site between 1896 and 1990. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>In 2006 the site was gazetted as a Public Purposes Reserve and a committee of management appointed. Restoration and development of the memorial commenced in the same year. On Anzac Day 2007 the Avenue was re-dedicated to all veterans who served Australia in times of conflict.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>As early as June 1915, the Victorian Minister of Public Instruction issued in the Education Gazette 'a notice in regard to the perpetuation within school buildings or in school-grounds of the memory of the old pupils who had enlisted'. In the first instance this took the form of honour rolls. With the conclusion of the war came an increase in interest manifested in the erection of war memorials. In 1919 the Director of Education issued an appeal to school committees and teachers saying 'more should be done to record their (soldiers') service and sacrifice'.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Buchan South certainly heeded the call. It is recorded that the school raised no less than 149 pounds 13 shillings and six pence for the War Relief Fund, a very large sum given the size of the school. The school created a very fine marble honour roll and Avenue of Honour both of which remain to this day.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Buchan South Avenue of Honour has local and regional significance. Many descendants of those commemorated in the avenue still reside in the area. Ceremonies on Anzac Day and Remembrance Day each year are well attended by both locals and those from further afield with connections with Buchan and District. </P>\r\n<P>In Australia, commemorative trees have been planted in public spaces since the late nineteenth century.

The Maddingley Park gates were originally located on the north east corner of Orrong and Balaclava Roads as gates to the grounds of a Caulfield mansion. They were probably installed as part of the extensive rebuilding of Judge Billing's old house in 1890 for Alexander William Robertson, a director of the Cobb and Co coaching empire. The gates were cast by Walter Macfarlane's foundry in Glasgow, Scotland. </P>\r\n<P>Maddingley Park, Bacchus Marsh, was established some time in the nineteenth century. When the grounds of the mansion were subdivided, the gates were acquired by the local branch of the Australian Natives Association and re-erected in February 1922 as a First World War memorial. War memorials were erected in large numbers throughout Australia following the Great War. Many were in the form of digger statues and other masonry monuments, while fewer, such as these gates, were of a more utilitarian nature. The memorials reflect the war's huge impact on Australian society at the time.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Marong Avenue of Honour, next to the Marong Hotel,was planted in 1920 to commemorate the First World War. The Avenue was planted with six palms, three of which are Canary Palms (<EM>Phoenix canariensis</EM>). Each palm was planted for a serviceman whodied in the war, their names are listed on the Marong Memorial Gates as, \"J. Green, J.G. Green, E.S. Goulden, L. Pocock, H.K. Palmer, F.E. Salis.\" Only three of the original palms survive.</P>\r\n<P>In Australia, commemorative trees have been planted in public spaces since the late nineteenth century. Arbor Days were held regularly in most Victorian State Schools during the late 1800s and early 1900s, and numerous trees were planted in parks in Melbourne and throughout Victoria to mark the visits of important and famous people. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>This tradition of commemorative planting was continued in 1901 when at the end of the Boer War trees were often planted for each soldier of the district who was killed in South Africa. These plantings, however, rarely consisted of more than two or three trees in each town.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>During and after the First World War avenues of honour consisting of trees lining significant streets became a popular form of commemoration. They represented a new egalitarian approach to the commemoration of soldiers where rank was not a consideration: each tree symbolises a person.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Avenues of honour are a uniquely Australian phenomenon. Australians, and in particular Victorians, embraced the idea of planting them more enthusiastically than any other country in the world. Dating from May 1916, the Eurack Avenue of Honour is the earliest known avenue of honour to be planted in Victoria. \r\n<P></P>By the time of the Second World War avenues of honour had declined in popularity as a means of commemoration. Today it is estimated that over 300 avenues of honour have been planted in Victoria to commemorate service personnel since 1901.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Richmond Rifles Volunteer Orderly Room was constructed in timber in 1867 with donations from members of the Richmond company of the Volunteer Rifle Corps. With the disbandment of the volunteer system in 1884 the Richmond building was one of the few orderly rooms substantial enough to be taken over by the new Victorian Department of Defence. The building was altered and extended in 1891 mainly by the addition of offices along the Gipps Street frontage and an attached Sergeant Major's residence on the Dickmann Street frontage to the design of Public Works Department Architect Samuel Bindley thereby giving the orderly room a superficial resemblance to other timber orderly rooms of the 1880s. The building was transferred to Commonwealth ownership after Federation in 1901 and was used for various Militia, Citizens Military Forces or Army Reserve units until the late 1980s.<BR><BR>The Richmond Rifle Corps was established during this period, and numbered seventy men, led by David S. Campbell (local Parliamentarian). The Richmond volunteers, were enthusiastic for their defence duties, at one stage remaining on permanent alert for six months. The Richmond corps were continuously called out from midnight to early morning for impromptu drilling, and night route marches. In 1861, the Richmond Corps were presented with colours, made by the women of Richmond. The Richmond Drill Hall was commenced in 1860, with members' donations and public subscriptions.</P>\r\n<P>Early drill halls became obsolete by the 1880's, as more extensive and complex facilities were required. In 1884 the Government took over ownership and management of existing facilities and the Public Works Department became responsible for the construction function. A programme of alterations and additions and new buildings for military units commenced in 1884. By 1886, plans were drawn up for proposed alterations and additions to the Richmond Drill Hall. Architect for these works was most probably S.E. Bindley. These plans however were not executed until 1891.</P>In 1896, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Boards of Works plan shows the enlarged timber Drill Hall in Gipps Street extended between Docker Street and Little Docker Street (now Dickman Street). The Drill Hall is constructed to a rectangular plan, and was executed in timber with a corrugated iron roof. The building is utilitarian in style to house its functions. The external appearance of the building was originally highlighted by decorative barge boards, collar ties and finials. The building is substantially intact and is repainted in an appropriate early colour scheme.<BR><BR>The Richmond Rifles Volunteer Orderly Room is one of only two surviving timber orderly rooms from the volunteer era of Victorian colonial defences, the other being the Collingwood Rifles orderly room in Powlett Street East Melbourne. Its continual use for defence training purposes over 120 years adds to its significance. ",

Several comparatively well preserved charcoal pits, some with brick lining, are located here. The remains include three pits 5 metres by 2 metres by 1 metre, with post holes around the edge of each pit and small charcoal mounds.</P>\r\n<P>A local from the area Joan Preece, remembers the significance of the site: \"During the Second World War building materials became very scarce and there was very little doing in the [family business] building line. Some of the younger men in our employ went off to the war but the older men were still with us. Dad [Albert Preece] was very worried about what to do, for he didn't want to sack them - they had been with us for years. He hit on the idea of burning charcoal for a living, and as some of you will remember, petrol was rationed and many people had charcoal burners installed in their vehicles. Also charcoal was used a lot in industry. I remember selling it to a big biscuit factory in Ballarat. So out to the wilds of the Kanya Forest went our men. A large shed was built and this was divided into sections - one end for sleeping quarters, the middle for eating quarters and the other end for the cooking. My father who had never cooked in his life became the camp cook. He got mum to show him how to cook various things and out he went...In the middle of the week and at the weekend Mum would cook a large piece of corned beef or similar and make a huge quantity of rock cakes to be used for morning and afternoon teas. Dad mastered the art of scone making and many other things and we were very grateful that it gave employment to our staff.\"</P>",

The large sheds which were serviced by the mobilisation siding and rail yards together with the adjacent associated buildings, the ordnance magazines and with the formation, alignment, and culvert of the siding itself are physical demonstrations of Seymour's role between the two world wars as the place of mobilisation for all Victorian troops and of the critical, but often ignored problems of logistic support for a citizen army when it receives its mobilisation orders.<BR><BR>Also in the precinct is the Victorian Railway Institute which provided a social hub for learning, dancing, billiards, tennis, bowls and other social activities, near to the place of work for railway employees, their families and visiting soldiers in the town.",

The trees were a tribute from the people of Mount Waverley, and were planted by the local community at what was the centre of the town. Portugal Oak trees were selected because of their long life and freedom from disease. Each tree planted represented one local service person who served in the war and originally a plaque noted each person's name at the base of each tree, these are no longer intact. The trees once lined both sides of the street, today only a single line of mature Portugal Oaks exists along the nature strip on southern side of High Street Road, between Fleet Street and Baringa Street. </P>\r\n<P>In Australia, commemorative trees have been planted in public spaces since the late nineteenth century. Arbor Days were held regularly in most Victorian State Schools during the late 1800s and early 1900s, and numerous trees were planted in parks in Melbourne and throughout Victoria to mark the visits of important and famous people. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>This tradition of commemorative planting was continued in 1901 when at the end of the Boer War trees were often planted for each soldier of the district who was killed in South Africa. These plantings, however, rarely consisted of more than two or three trees in each town.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>During and after the First World War avenues of honour consisting of trees lining significant streets became a popular form of commemoration. They represented a new egalitarian approach to the commemoration of soldiers where rank was not a consideration: each tree symbolises a person.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Avenues of honour are a uniquely Australian phenomenon. Australians, and in particular Victorians, embraced the idea of planting them more enthusiastically than any other country in the world. The earliest known planting of an avenue of honour in Victoria is at Eurack which commenced in May 1916.\r\n<P></P>By the time of the Second World War avenues of honour had declined in popularity as a means of commemoration. Today it is estimated that over 300 avenues of honour have been planted in Victoria to commemorate service personnel since 1901.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Puckapunyal Army Camp was first established by the Commonwealth government in 1939. In 1942, the Camp saw the raising of the first Victorian contingent, the 17th brigade, to be sent overseas in the Second World War. As a camp with an extensive range attached, it was the permanent or transient home for infantry, artillery and armoured units, as well as many specialist and support troops. After the war, while other camps were abandoned or converted to other uses, Puckapunyal actually expanded to become the biggest army camp in Victoria. The universal 90-day national service scheme of the 1950s meant that a generation of Victorian men passed through the galvanised iron huts of Puckapunyal in those years. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Puckapunyal Military Area is situated 10 kilometres west of Seymour on the northern slopes of the Central Victorian highlands. It is rolling country varying in altitude from 130m in the north-east to 413m in the south. Since colonial times, the Seymour/Puckapunyal area has been a major focus for military training in Victoria. The area was used for training civilian militia, in the days when the Australian colonies had to rely substantially on volunteer forces for their defence. In 1910, Lord Kitchener toured Australia as a military adviser to the new Commonwealth and recommended the Seymour district as an ideal training and marshalling location for Victorian contingents in times of war or emergency. This recommendation was based largely on its central location and excellent access to Melbourne and other country districts via rail. In response, the Commonwealth began leasing and purchasing property in the region, which became the prime focus for defence training in Victoria.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>By the outbreak of the Second World War, there were several army facilities in and around Seymour, and these multiplied dramatically during the course of the war, especially with large numbers of American troops either stationed here or passing through. The Commonwealth purchased 14,119 acres in 1939, at Puckapunyal at a cost of over 72,000 pounds for the location of a new artillery and infantry range. A camp area was established in the south-eastern extremity of the base, stocked with the standard mass-designed corrugated iron buildings found universally throughout Australian military camps of the era. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>With the outbreak of the Korean War, Puckapunyal once more became the prime focus of military training in Victoria, for both the standing army and recruits through the National Service scheme. From 1965 to 1972, Puckapunyal was once again a major training establishment for recruits under the controversial conscription ballot scheme during the Vietnam War. This time the scheme called for a ballot of eligible twenty year olds for service in the army for two years. The Australia army's on-going modernisation process since the Second World War has meant that most of the wartime buildings have been demolished or removed. Apart from scattered examples such as the former Camp Headquarters and the 21 Construction Squad's compound.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>At present the Puckapunyal area is the home of specialist regular army units and is the major training area for reservists. It currently hosts activities such as artillery firing (since the relocation of the Artillery Centre from North Head in NSW), tank and armoured vehicle training, RAAF bombing and strafing exercises (and other air support manoeuvres), mortar and grenade training, transport driver training and infantry exercises. During the Vietnam War, the Range contained a full scale replica of a Vietnamese village, which assisted the training of troops for village combat. This replica village no longer exists. </P>\r\n<P></P>The Royal Australian Armoured Corps, which trains personnel in all forms of armoured warfare, has the longest continuous association with Puckapunyal, having served there since 1942. The Proof and Experimental Station, on the northern perimeter of the range, has also been an important facility in the test-firing of experimental military technology since 1951. Puckapunyal today remains one of Australia's largest and most significant Army bases.",

ANZAC day ceremonies were held on the small assembly ground at the entrance to the hall from the early 1920s until the 1970s when the highway was widened to absorb the assembly area. Several monuments were also located in front of the hall until this time. These were relocated to Cheltenham Park and subsequently to the new Cheltenham RSL Club in Centre Dandenong Road, Heatherton. In addition, the hall was used by the Methodist Home for Children as a School until the home could afford to build its own building. The Beaumaris School (now Cheltenham State School) also used the building to accommodate excess students. Church groups and sporting organisations used the hall for annual balls, regular dances and other social functions. From the 1920's until the 1950s, the hall served as Cheltenham's picture theatre with regular showings of films and newsreels. The first public viewing of television in Cheltenham took place at the hall. \r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The hall remained in use by the RSL until the late 1970s when it became Columns Receptions. It has subsequently been used as a bingo hall and more recently as Fernwood Female Fitness Centre.</P>\r\n<P>At the time of the construction of the Cheltenham Protestant Hall, another hall appears to have occupied the rear of the adjacent site to the south. This hall was often referred to as 'the orderly room' and was the home of the Cheltenham Rangers Unit before becoming the meeting place for the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League. A further building closer to the highway frontage was constructed c.1910s and was subsequently used as a billiards room. Both of these structures have since been demolished.

    "name": "Sunbury War Memorial",
    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Sunbury Soldiers Memorial on Stawell Street, was erected in 1921 to commemorate the First World War. Subsequently two plaques have been added one at the end of the Second World War and another to commemorate those who had fought in Korea, Vietnam and Malaya. The process of erecting the cenotaph monument in Sunbury has been well recorded. In December 1918 the<I> Sunbury News</I> put forward the suggestion that a 'soldiers monument should be erected in some prominent position in the town.' With the intention of giving the idea a solid start and 'in the hope that some worthy memorial to the glorious deeds of our gallant lads will be the result' they announced the opening of a subscription list to which they donated the first £5. The <I>News</I> then proposed that they would acknowledge all amounts received from the community in the newspaper and at a later stage a meeting of these subscribers could be convened to decide on a course of action. As the <I>News</I> urged 'here is an opportunity for every patriotic citizen to show his appreciation, in a tangible way, of Sunbury's great effort in finding over three hundred of her sons ready to answer the Empire's Call.'</P>\r\n<P>For the next six or so months, the subscription funds accumulated slowly and there were problems as to when and where the memorial would eventually be erected. However, in July 1919, it was announced that Sir Rupert Clarke had offered to pay for the memorial which he intended to erect to the memory of his nephew Lieut. Keith MacDonald who had been killed in France. Clarke had selected Sunbury as the site for the monument because of its long-term association with the Clarke family - as exemplified by their Sunbury property <I>Rupertswood</I> - and he asked the memorial committee to select a location for its erection.</P>\r\n<P>Not long after, in September 1919, the <I>News</I> on behalf of the Bulla Shire Soldiers' Memorial Committee published a list of soldiers' names connected with the Shire who had enlisted and served with the A.I.F. This was to inform the community of the names to be inscribed on the monument because the committee required notification of any omissions or inaccuracies.</P>\r\n<P>The erection of the monument itself did not start until almost a year later. The committee had chosen a site at the triangular tip of the intersection of Stawell and Barkly Streets in front of the Sunbury State School and the contractor began work some time in early August 1920. By the middle of October, the <I>News</I> reported that the monumental masons, Messrs. James Taylor &amp; Sons of Footscray had made 'good headway' with the brick footings for the monument but it appeared that it would be some time before the stone work was ready, due to the scarcity of labour and material. Even so, the <I>News</I> reported, it was expected that the memorial would be finished before the end of the year.</P>\r\n<P>This was not to be the case, and it was not until mid-January 1921 that the stonework began to arrive in Sunbury. Because of the size and weight of the stonework, two cranes were required. The stonework was transported to Sunbury by train and the Railways Department supplied the crane needed to unload it. Another crane was used at the site to manoeuvre the sections into place. By mid-January the massive plates containing the names of the district soldiers had also arrived; they came from Sydney. Enthusiasm for the project seems to have still been strong and the <I>Sunbury News</I> opined that 'there will be few, if any, better soldiers memorials of this class in Australia'. </P>\r\n<P>Strikes by the stonemasons interrupted work on the erection of the monument but by the end of March the tiers of the stone base had been placed in position. Finally, in November of that year the <I>News</I> announced that the official unveiling of the Sunbury Soldiers Memorial would take place on Sunday 27 November at 3.30 p.m.</P>\r\n<P>In the next issue of the newspaper, the <I>News</I> devoted two full columns of its broadsheet to a report of the ceremony, calling it 'a unique event in the history of Sunbury' at which a large gathering was present. The memorial was officially unveiled by Sir Rupert Clarke and speeches were made by many notable members of the community including the Shire President, the ministers of each of the churches and the president of the Sunbury Branch of the R.S.S.I.L. of Australia.</P>\r\n<P>The report also noted that the cost of the memorial was around £4000 and that three of the massive copper plates carried the names of the 180 boys and men who had enlisted from the shire. It then went on to describe the structure in great detail:</P>\r\n<P>\"The memorial (one of the finest that has been erected in the Southern Hemisphere in remembrance and in honour of the Australian soldier in the Great War) is unique - both massive and chaste; beautiful, but not over-chaste. Made of the finest grey granite, it rises, tapering tier upon tier, from a base seventeen feet square. The last of the pedestal tiers supports the main square monument, with its four sides inlaid with pure bronze tablets, 4ft. 10in. x 3ft. 9in., upon three sides of which are inscribed the names of the men. Above this, tapering gradually, the granite rises with serrated edges to support a branching ornamental bronze column, from each of the four branches of which there hangs an electric bulb enclosed in a large white globe, the whole being crowned by a very large electric bulb and globe . . . The monument is a model of symmetry, and the fine lines of carving on the stone and bronze reveal a delicate taste. On the fourth bronze face of the monument, surmounted by the Clarke coat-of-arms, is the inscription indicating the originating cause of the gift - the loss at the war of Sir Rupert's nephew, Lieut. Keith MacDonald - together with the names of the thirty-two others who made the supreme sacrifice. The monument is protected by a triangular enclosure, with a low parapet of the same grey granite, rough-hewn; each side of the parapet is fifty feet. Salmon-coloured sand within the enclosure arrests the passer-by and shows the monument in striking relief from . . . base to crowning globe. For each of the corners of this triangular enclosure Sir Rupert intends to secure one of the German guns captured in the war. The black guns against the grey granite will complete a beautiful and massive design.\"</P>\r\n<P>This description was worth quoting almost in full because the memorial has changed little in appearance since that time. It seems, however, that the guns were never added as intended. </P>\r\n<P>The memorial was moved from its original site to its present site in front of the Sunbury Memorial Hall in 1974 when the triangular piece of land it was located on was removed by the Council because it was a danger to traffic.</P>",

The memorial was erected circa 1921-22 after theYarra Junction Progress Society commissioned the work and organised for the money to be raised by public subscription, with fundraising activities such as concerts. The local council also contributed funds. It was estimated by the Yarra Progress Society in 1920 that the memorial would cost around 500 pounds. The memorial commemorates the local community's involvement in the First World War. A wall was added behind the statue to commemorate the community's ongoing remembrance of those who have fought and died in the later wars: the Second World War, Korea, Malaya, Borneo and Vietnam.</P>",

Early photographs show it set in small well planted garden beds edged in quartz stones and protected by woven wire fences. </P>\r\n<P>During the First World War, 137 men from the Avoca area volunteered for the armed services and of this number 29 were killed. In response, it was decided to erect a memorial in the main street plantation and a Local Soldiers Memorial Committee was formed. The first appeal for funds was made in March 1918. <BR></P>\r\n<P>In 1920 the Committee advertised for the submission of designs.

A local resident, Robert Kaye, donated a quantity of bluestone towards its construction. The memorial was finally completed at a cost of around £1800, the whole amount being raised by public subscription. It was unveiled during a 'Back to Avoca' held in November 1921. The 'Little Digger' Billy Hughes, the prime minister, was even invited as guest of honour but was unable to attend.<BR></P>\r\n<P>The Memorial was later rededicated to include the Second World War.</P>",

At that stage the area boasted a timber lighthouse that had previously been the leading light at Queenscliff, a telegraph station, flagstaff and array of other assorted buildings including a powder magazine. These buildings have now all been demolished and in most cases replaced with new buildings including the concrete lighthouse built in 1901-02 and the pier built in 1889-90.</P>\r\n<P>A series of reinforced concrete emplacements were installed around the lighthouse tower, probably in the late 1930s or early 1940s.

Each has two rooms: a reinforced concrete swivel emplacement and a windowless room behind. Entry is through a set of steps that descend into each shelter. The first is placed at the head of the beach, being partly built into the cliffs. The second is immediately below the lighthouse, near Buckley's Cave. The third is on the main dune rise to the west of the main lighthouse tower.

Two at least have reinforced concrete stems inside to support the lights or armament that was intended. An enclosed space immediately behind could have served as a work room, rest space, shelter or plotting room. Entry from outside is down a short flight of concrete stairs, rather in the manner of contemporary air-raid shelter design. They are weakening with time, and the central south emplacement is off limits as the structure is considered unsafe.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Bofors anti-aircraft gun is mounted on a plinth and situated within the median strip in Anzac Road, Moe. It is thought to be similar to those installed by the Commonwealth Government around Yallourn Power Station as part of defence measures during the Second World War. In the mid-1970s, the Defence Department offered surplus military hardware to RSL clubs as part of their war memorials, and the Moe Branch installed the Bofors gun as a part of a memorial which has since been relocated to 63-67 Albert Street.</P>\r\n<P>During the Second World War, the old Yallourn Power Station made a significant contribution to the war by ensuring a constant supply of power to heavy industry that kept the war machine turning. Between 1940 and 1942, Yallourn Power Station was responsible for generating more than two-thirds of Victoria's electricity, and logically it would have been a major target if the Japanese forces, rapidly moving south through Asia by the end of that period, had attacked.<BR><BR>For this reason, the governments of the day set about shoring up Yallourn's defences. About £30,000 was spent on additional fire protection at principal SEC sites at Yallourn, while many precautions were taken to protect buildings and workers in case of an enemy air attack. These included the construction of earth walls, blacking out windows, protective casings for vital plant equipment, air raid shelters for key personnel and the construction of walls made from brick and concrete. These walls were designed to withstand the impact of a high explosive 500 pound (227 kilogram) bomb detonating at 16 metres.<BR><BR>By the middle of 1941, the 11th Australian Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery unit began its protection of Yallourn Power Station and the project area. Four guns, three inch 30 cwt mobile units, were initially provided to guards against air raids while gun crews, headquarters personnel and machine gun units were allocated to the works area. The Old Brown Coal Mine and the south west end of the Yallourn ovals were selected as sites for 3.7 inch guns. Each round for one of these guns weighed 49 pounds (22 kilograms), and to operate the gun took 11 men.<BR><BR>Bofors guns were later placed behind the briquette factory, near the open cut office, on the far side of the Latrobe River on the hill opposite the power station and between the screen house and the open cut. An extensive network of volunteers, were the eyes and ears of the formidable range of 'AckAck' guns around the works area. Aircraft were prohibited from air space within eight kilometres of the open cut. Fortunately, the guns were only fired once in anger; a night in December 1941 when a large Melbourne-bound plane strayed into the prohibited area. The plane was not, as suspected, a Japanese bomber.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Crows Nest Camp Searchlight Emplacements developed from a 1908 proposal to build electric searchlights which would be controlled from the directing station at Fort Queenscliff. These facilities would replace the existing searchlights, which then required four men to operate them, although it was unclear if the earlier lights were at the base of shortlands bluff or at Crows Nest. A tender to build the facility was accepted in November and 3 acres of land to the west of the recreational reserve was cleared to accommodate it. The borough council bitterly complained about the lack of consultation and unsolicited loss of tourist facilities when the work began in late November 1908. When the facility was installed, complaints were received about the noise of the generator keeping people awake at night in 1910.Some residents were hostile towards the defence forces after the military reclaimed areas of park reserve land for the installation of searchlights at Crows Nest, and the noise associated with their operation at night. </P>\r\n<P>Nonetheless the boom of continuous gunfire exercises and looms from fixed searchlights became a way of life in Queenscliff. The searchlights appear to have been used on a number of occasions to aid in times of shipwrecks, in particular the <I>Edward</I> which wrecked on Corsair Rock in 1912. There were two pairs of Fighting lights at Point Nepean and also at Queenscliff in the 1920s, one of which was at beach level, and there was also a light at Pt Lonsdale. They had a range of about 9000 yards.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941 saw the realisation of the potential of air power for long distance attacks. The lights were again regained significance. Anti-aircraft guns were installed in the local football field, along with a 4 inch gun at Crows Nest to combat this threat. A local resident, George Werry recalled the use of the lights during the Second World War: \"There was night time searchlight practice at Queenscliff in those days. The planes would come down (from Melbourne or Geelong) and during the day the planes towed targets for anti-aircraft practice.\"</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Located on the foreshore reserve, each emplacement is partly set into the sand, and faces south toward The Rip and the Bass Strait beyond. Originally, each emplacement appears to have consisted of two rooms: a reinforced concrete room and a windowless room behind. The front chamber has an open space for traversing a light or weapon; this is sheltered by a reinforced concrete slab cantilevered over the working space immediately below it. The square concrete pad of the roof contains a circular arrangement of raised iron bolts from the former gun mounting. The rear room possibly served as a work room, rest space, shelter or plotting room. Entry was via a set of concrete steps that descend into each shelter. Both structures are in poor repair with the concrete gradually breaking up in the harsh coastal environment. The eastern of the two structures is the more intact.</P>",

These concrete bunkers were erected as ammunition storage shelters at this time c. early 1940s.

The trees were planted to commemorate the service of district men in the First World War. Of the 134 men from Mortlake and surrounding area who left home to serve in the First World War, a total of 42 men never returned. The name plaques along this avenue were refurbished in 2011.</P>\r\n<P>There was some controversy early on, as trees were also planted as soldiers memorials in the recreation reserve, and the recipients of these trees 'felt that they were being relegated to the back blocks.' The local paper reported in July 1919: 'The planting of the trees was carried out last Tuesday and altogether 85 trees were planted. To complete the avenue another fifty trees at least are required so that every man who enlisted from the town may be represented.' It is not clear whether trees were planted for every man who enlisted. Today the avenue is the more remarkable for the intact brass name plates still set beneath many of the trees. The names on the plates include G. Donnelly, G. Clifford, G. Melville, Dr Lee, D. McKinnoch.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>At the end of the Second World War, additional trees were planted. It is believed that around 202 trees made up the full avenue, and with 11 or 12 trees missing, there are 191 trees still standing (100 on the north side and 91 on the south).The large numbers of trees planted in the Mortlake Avenue of Honour, and their maintenance over the years, owes to the strength of the RSL in the district following the First World War and the subsequent development of soldier settlement estates, which drew over two hundred returned soldiers to the Shire.</P>\r\n<P>In Australia, commemorative trees have been planted in public spaces since the late nineteenth century.

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Bendigo Sandakan Memorial was unveiled in 1995 and is dedicated to the men of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania who perished at Sandakan and Ranau in North Borneo during the Second World War. It is one of several memorials established by the Sandakan memorial Foundation between 1993 and 1995. Others were erected in NSW, at Burwood, Tamworth, Wagga Wagga, Maitland, in Brisbane and at Boyup Brook in Western Australia.</P>\r\n<P>The Sandakan memorials take the form of a topographical scale model, cast in bronze, of a section of the Crocker Range in Sabah. A brass ribbon demonstrates the 265-kilometre route of the death marches from Sandakan to Ranau in the foothills of Mt Kinabalu. The sculpture rests on a shelf of Riverina granite quarried at Tocumwal, the whole being supported by brickwork which in turn supports the bronze honour roll plaques.</P>\r\n<P>The mould for the sculpture was made by Don Wall, an ex-prisoner of war whose book inspired the project, and Tom Connolly whose father was among the last of the priosoners massacred at Ranau.</P>\r\n<P>Sandakan is located at the north-east corner of Borneo in present day Sabah, Malaysia. During the Second World War, it was to be the site of a Japanese airfield, constructed by Australian and British prisoners of war, captured after the fall of Singapore in February 1942.</P>\r\n<P>In July 1942, the first of 2434 prisoners of war (1787 Australians and 641 British) were transported from Singapore to Sandakan. For the first two years, conditions were comparable to working for the Japanese elsewhere in the reigon: much brutality, illness and starvation.</P>\r\n<P>In mid 1944, however, rations at Sandakan were further cut and particularly vicious guards arrived from Formosa (Taiwan). Conditions deteriorated rapidly. Torture became normal, with starving and ill men crammed into an open-air cage without food or water for days at a time. At Sandakan, work on the Japanese airfield had stopped by January 1945, mainly as a result of Allied Air raids. In January, the rice ration ceased, and prisoners were only allowed 70 grams per day from whatever had been accumulated.</P>\r\n<P>The first of the death marches began on 28 January when 455 prisoners in wretched condition were forced to walk from Sandakan to Ranau, 260 kilometres away up a barely scratched track. By mid February, 114 had died along the way, and the last of the survivors arrived at Ranau.</P>\r\n<P>While a rescue plan involving trained Australian paratroops had been devised, it relied on intelligence supplied by Australian Z Special Forces secretly operating in Borneo. It seems that faulty intelligence was supplied in April 1945 that all prisoners had been moved from Sandakan, and the plan to rescue them, codenamed Operation Kingfisher, was never undertaken. But even after the first march, hundreds of prisoners were still alive at Sandakan. This was a failure of intelligence and will that had horrendous consequences; after the war everyone from General Macarthur and General Blamey down was blamed.</P>\r\n<P>Allied air raids on Sandakan in late May 1945 seem to have prompted the Japanese to move any remaining prisoners who could still walk out of reach of rescue. On 29 May, they sent 536 prisoners on the second forced march to Ranau and burned the camp buildings. The 288 prisoners of war who were too sick to walk were left behind in the ruins. On 15 June, a further seventy-five were sent up the track; all perished. At the end of June, the 183 survivors of the secondmarch arrived at Ranau to find just six men alive from those who had walked in January.</P>\r\n<P>At the end of July, there were just forty men, barely alive, at Ranau and ten at Sandakan. The last man at Sandakan was murdered on 15 August. His name isn't known, but he was an Australian. This was the day that Emperor Hirohito conceded that the war was not 'necessarily going in Japan's favour', and offered unconditional surrender. The Australian was beheaded and kicked into a ditch. At Ranau, the fifteen men still alive were not executed until 27 August.</P>\r\n<P>Just six men, all Australian, had escaped the death marches and bore witness - Keith Botterill, Richard Braithewaite, Owen Campbell, Bill Moxham, Nelson Short and Bill Sticpewich. Fifteen of the Japanese officers were tried after the war; four were found guilty of murder and were hanged at Rabaul.</P>\r\n<P>One such Sandakanprisoner was Gunner Albert Cleary, 2/15th Australian Field Regiment, from East Geelong, was born on 16 June 1919. He survived the first march to Ranau. In March, Cleary, along with Gunner Wally Crease, escaped from Ranau.</P>\r\n<P>After four days on the run, Cleary was recaptured. He had clearly been beaten-up before his return to the camp. His arms were tied high up behind his back, and he was then tortured for several days and nights. Crease managed to escape again but was recaptured and shot. Keith Botterill, who had been sent away from Ranau for four days on a work detail, returned to find Cleary barely alive, tied by the neck to a tree, dressed only in a small loincloth. Cleary was filthy, covered in caked blood and suffering from dysentery. He was left to lie in his own excreta for the next eleven or twelve days.</P>\r\n<P>When the guards could see that Cleary was dying, he was thrown into the gutter beside the road. Eventually, he was allowed to be taken away by his comrades. They carried him to a stream, washed him, and brought him back to be among them in oneof the huts. On 20 March 1945, Gunner Albert Cleary, aged 22, died. A memorial to Gunner Cleary was erected at Ranau in 1985.</P>",

Block expressed his hope that years after the conflict had been forgotten the towering, dignified Pine trees would be a reminder to the next generation of the sacrifices made by their forebears.

Arbor Days were held regularly in most Victorian State Schools during the late 1800s and early 1900s, and numerous trees were planted in parks in Melbourne and throughout Victoria to mark the visits of important and famous people. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>This tradition of commemorative planting was continued in 1901 when at the end of the Boer War trees were often planted for each soldier of the district who was killed in South Africa. These plantings, however, rarely consisted of more than two or three trees in each town.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>During and after the First World War avenues of honour consisting of trees lining significant streets became a popular form of commemoration. They represented a new egalitarian approach to the commemoration of soldiers where rank was not a consideration: each tree symbolises a person.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Avenues of honour are a uniquely Australian phenomenon. Australians, and in particular Victorians, embraced the idea of planting them more enthusiastically than any other country in the world. The Eurack Avenue of Honour is the earliest known avenue of honour in Victoriawith planting commencing in May 1916.\r\n<P></P>By the time of the Second World War avenues of honour had declined in popularity as a means of commemoration. Today it is estimated that over 300 avenues of honour have been planted in Victoria to commemorate service personnel since 1901.</P>",

Further research is required on this place.</P>\r\n<P>In Australia, commemorative trees have been planted in public spaces since the late nineteenth century. Arbor Days were held regularly in most Victorian State Schools during the late 1800s and early 1900s, and numerous trees were planted in parks in Melbourne and throughout Victoria to mark the visits of important and famous people. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>This tradition of commemorative planting was continued in 1901 when at the end of the Boer War trees were often planted for each soldier of the district who was killed in South Africa. These plantings, however, rarely consisted of more than two or three trees in each town.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>During and after the First World War avenues of honour consisting of trees lining significant streets became a popular form of commemoration. They represented a new egalitarian approach to the commemoration of soldiers where rank was not a consideration: each tree symbolises a person.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Avenues of honour are a uniquely Australian phenomenon. Australians, and in particular Victorians, embraced the idea of planting them more enthusiastically than any other country in the world. The Eurack Avenue of Honour is the earliest known avenue of honour to be planted in Victoria and dates from May 1916. \r\n<P></P>By the time of the Second World War avenues of honour had declined in popularity as a means of commemoration. Today it is estimated that over 300 avenues of honour have been planted in Victoria to commemorate service personnel since 1901.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2><P>The Gringegalgona Soldier's Memorial Hall, is located on the west side of the Coleraine-Balmoral Road, just north of the intersection of Gringe Dip Road, was built in 1925 by the local community as a tribute and memorial to those who fought and died in World War One. The land appears to have been given by William Toleman. According to the title, the Crown sold one acre for &#8356;4 'as a site for a Public Hall' on 21st April 1925. The trustees were Alexander John Watt, Henry Joseph Brody, Michael J Byrne, John James Smith and William Toleman, the last three being returned soldiers. A Mr V Yuill drew up the plans, possibly Vine Yuill of Sandford who was probably related to W J Yuill another one of the returned soldiers. The builder was a Mr Burgin whose tender was &#8356;490. </P>\r\n<P>The Soldier Settlement Board, or Closer Settlement Board, had subdivided the Gringegalgona Estate in 1920.The squatting run, famous for its wool growing capability, dated from the early 1840s. It had been owned by two families, the first led by Simon Cadden, the second by Duncan Robertson and then his son, William 'Gringe' Robertson. The former built the fine two-storey mansion in 1873. Even by the early twentieth century the run still comprised 28,000 acres of open woodland country watered by dams, tanks and waterholes, and was stocked with 25,000 merino sheep. William Robertson died in 1918. The successful soldier settler applicants for the subdivided blocks were announced in the <I>Argus</I> in October 1940.</P>\r\n<P>Twenty-eight returned soldiers eventually settled on blocks of between 800 and 1000 acres, building homes from trees they supplied to the local sawmill, improving the pastures, growing wool and planting crops. By 1923 rabbits had appeared in unprecedented numbers, eating the country bare of feed to such an extent that the sheep numbers on many blocks were reduced to around 300, and these in a state of near starvation. Some settlers soon failed and walked off their blocks. Others sought work on the roads, cutting timber, or shearing. Notwithstanding the dire times, the first meeting about the hall was held in the home of H J Brody. Money was raised by holding sports meetings and gymkhanas. During the construction, the <I>Argus </I>noted 'The Gringegalgona Soldiers Memorial Hall benefited to the extent of £114/4/6 as the result of a gymkhana and £170 was raised for the hall at Pigeon Ponds in a similar way'. The hall at Gringegalgona was typical of the practical local response to the deep national grief after the death and injury of World War One.</P>\r\n<P>Memorial halls were built throughout Victoria, often associated with sporting facilities such as tennis courts. Their scale varied from modest halls like that at Gringegalgona, all that could be expected from small, new and often isolated communities, through to much more formal buildings in established towns. A small number of memorial halls were multi-purpose and even lavish in the facilities provided for the returned soldiers. One of the grandest was the new municipal complex at Jeparit, also built in 1925 but costing &#8356;8,100, a combined effort of the local Mechanics Institute, the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia (later known as the Returned &amp; Services League of Australia), local citizens and the Dimboola Shire Council. It was partly funded by cinema ticket sales. Interestingly, there is no mention of films being screened at the Gringegalgona hall. Perhaps the most symbolic example, however, is the memorial hall at the tiny settlement of Paschendale, near Merino in the Glenelg Shire, which was completed in 1928. The Gringegalgona Memorial Hall must be seen as the best the community could achieve in the circumstances.</P>\r\n<P>It is clear that the Gringegalgona Memorial Hall fulfilled its practical objective and became a focus for community activities including through the Great Depression and another World War. It provided 'a venue for concerts, dances, church services and usual gatherings after sporting events'. Anglicans, Presbyterians, Methodists and Lutherans conducted church services at the hall including baptisms, conformations and Sunday school. The last church service to be held was in December 1960. Functions were still held regularly in the hall until the 1970s including an Annual [Melbourne] Cup luncheon and card evenings organised by Ruth Toleman. Mrs Toleman cut the ribbon at the Ball held to celebrate the arrival of electricity, first supplied by the State Electricity Commission in October 1965.The photograph taken of local dignitaries includes women wearing furs with corsages and one of the original soldier settlers, Mr J J Smith and his wife. It can be surmised that the decline in activities would be due to improved transportation and better roads, allowing easier access to Hamilton and Horsham, and the introduction of television, for which electricity was essential, in the 1960s. More recently, the hall has been used for garden club events, community barbecues and CFA meetings. </P>",

Kamesburgh was built in 1874 for businessman William Kerr Thomson by builder David Mitchell to the design of architect Lloyd Tayler. The property remained a domestic dwelling until the ownership of the prominent pastoralist, financier and politician Duncan McBryde. </P>\r\n<P>In 1918, negotiations with the Repatriation Department led to purchase from McBryde by the well-known Melbourne businessmen and philanthropists, the Baillieu brothers. The Baillieu brothers bought the property for £25000, gifting it as a rehabilitation centre for severely incapacitated ex-servicemen who required constant observation and nursing care, though not hospital treatment. The donation was the largest Australian philanthropic gift for veterans of the First World War and was later formalised in the Repatriation Fund (Baillieu Gift) Act of 1937. The Baillieu brothers in agreeing to this purchase desired that when the purpose for which the hostel had been acquired had been fully served, the hostel should be realised and the proceeds applied to provide university scholarships tenable by lineal descendents of ex-servicemen who were deceased or totally and permanently incapacitated as a result of war service. The Kamesburgh mansion was renamed Anzac Hostel and formally opened on 5th July 1919 by Sir Arthur Stanley, Governor of Victoria.</P>\r\n<P>In this period the building was converted with the addition of a lift and an enlargement of the service wings and the administration of the building handed to the Red Cross.When it first opened the Hostel had twenty-five beds and seven nurses on staff. The Repatriation Department also constructed an occupational therapy building (the day centre) and a mortuary. The Anzac Hostel continued to provide care for disabled servicemen from 1919 until 30th June 1995 when the house was converted for use as a school. However a new Anzac Hostel was built on the grounds and opened 27th July, 1998.</P>",

The citation reads:</P>\r\n<P><EM>Whilst leading his platoon with the first wave, Lieutenant Borella marked an enemy machine gun firing though our barrage. He ran out ahead of his men into the barrage, shot two German machine gunners with his revolver, and captured the gun. He then led his party, now reduced to ten men and two Lewis guns, against a very strongly held trench, using his revolver, and later a rifle, with great effect, causing many enemy casualties. His leading and splendid example resulted in the garrison being quickly shot or captured.</EM></P>\r\n<P>Borella was born at Borung, Victoria, and educated at Borung and Echuca districts; he also served for eighteen months with the Victorian Rangers. In 1910, he was a fireman in Melbourne, resigning in January 1913 to take up a pastoral lease, drawn by ballot, on the Daly River. </P>\r\n<P>In 1915, Borella was a cook for a survey party in Tennant Creek and set out for Queensland to volunteer for active service. At the outbreak of the war, volunteers from the Northern Territory were not being accepted. With Charlie, an Aboriginal man, he walked 88 miles (140 kilometres) and swam across flooded rivers. After borrowing a horse at powell Creek, just north of Renner Springs, Northern Territory, he rode to Katherine, where he caught the mail coach to the railhead at Pine Creek. He sailed from Darwin to Townsville on 8 March 1915 with four other men who were among the first fifteen volunteers for active service from the Northern Territory.</P>\r\n<P>Borella enlisted in the 26th Battalion in March 1915 and served at Gallipoli before proceeding to the Western Front. Lieutenant Borella received the Military Medal for conspicuous bravery in the attack on Malt Trench, north of Warlencourt on the night of 1 March 1917, winning the Victoria Cross a year later in 1918.</P>\r\n<P>At the end of the war, Borella was invalided back to Australia. From 1920, he farmed a soldier settlement block near Hamilton in Victoria. In 1924, he stood for the seat of Dundas in the Victorian Legislative Assembly as the National Party candidate, but was narrowly defeated.</P>\r\n<P>On the outbreak of the Second World War, Borella was appointed lieutenant in the 12th Australian Garrison Battalion with which he served until 1941 when he was attached to the Prisoner of War Group at Rushworth. Promoted to captain on 1 September 1942, he served with the 51st Garrison Company at Myrtleford until discharged in 1945. He then moved to Albury where he died in 1968 and was buried in North Albury.</P>",

He enlisted in the Australian Army Medical Corps (6th Division) on 13 November 1939 as Medical Officer, Headquarters, Australian Overseas Base, Jerusalem, and appointed Acting Assistant Director of Medical Services.

With the withdrawal of the 6th and 7th Divisions from the Middle East, Dunlop and the 2/2nd Casualty Clearing Station were transferred to Java.

In January 1944, sufficient supplies had arrived for the 18th Brigade, including the 2/9th to force the Japanese off the ridge.</P>\r\n<P>The attack began on 19 January. On 21 January, A Company of the 2/9th attacked a Japanese position named Green Sniper's Pimple, the highest point on Shaggy Ridge. The unexpected direction of these attacks, up slopes the Japanese obviously regarded as almost impassable, allowed the Australians to establish foothold quickly, and it was secured by the end of the day. Their new occupants, however, had to withstand several counter-attacks and persistent and accurate artillery bombardment. Four men were killed, including Sergeant Clarke.</P>",

The memorial comprises of a stone pedestal topped by a green metal wreath; which features a golden hand clasping a cross and a star joining the two fronds at the top and an Italian helmet at the base. On the front face of the pedestal is a map of Italy and the inscription: \"<EM>Who for the homeland spent life and more. This monument was erected by Italian prisoners of war in the Rushworth (Vic)concentration camp and transported to this Italian chapel of Murchison (Vic) on 7th September 1968 through the interest of Cavilieri Urbano A. Segafredo President and Founder of the Bendigo Section of the Italian Federation of Ex Service and War Veterans</EM>.\" The memorial was moved to Murchison in 1968 from Rushworth, where it had been constructed by Italian prisoners of war. </P>\r\n<P>During the Second World War, 4000 Italian, German and Japanese prisoners of war were detained at Murchison. Those who died at Murchison were buried in the local cemetery, but floods in 1956 did major damage to the graves. Luigi Gigliotti persuaded Italian families living in the Goulburn Valley to pay for the building of a mausoleum - the Ossario. He also managed to persuade the authorities to bury all the Italian prisoners of war and detainees who died in Australian prison camps in the mausoleum, which was completed in 1961. </P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Queenscliff H.M.A.S Goorangai Memorial commemorates the loss of the ship in November 1940. Sunk in a collision with the loss of the entire crew of 24, the 223 ton gross minesweeper HMAS Goorangai has the tragic distinction of being all at once Australia's first naval loss of World War II, the first Royal Australian Navy surface vessel lost in a war, and the first Royal Australian Navy surface vessel lost with all hands. It had just returned from its minesweeping operations in Bass Strait including recovering wreck debris from the City of Rayville with Lieut-Commander Gordon Boyle on board as minesweeping adviser and was enjoying a respite from bad weather while reprovisioning in Port Phillip.</P>\r\n<P>Originally built as a 'Castle' type steam trawler based on a North Sea design, it was intended to assist develop a trawl fishing industry to create jobs in NSW in Depression years but was then requisitioned by the RAN in the Second World War. Following the sinking of the SS Cambridge and MV City of Rayville in Bass Strait by German mines on 7th and 8th November 1940 respectively, three minesweepers including the HMAS Goorangai were ordered to the sweep the shipping lanes and approaches to Port Phillip, and within a fortnight were able to locate and destroy forty mines. Prime Minister Menzies also called for Australian war vessels in the Mediterranean to be returned to Australian waters, and the fated HMAS Sydney (to be later sunk by the German raider Kormoran off Western Australia with the loss of all 645 crew) was one of these vessels, returning in April 1941.</P>\r\n<P>At night in wartime 'brown-out' (minimal lights exhibited) conditions the HMAS Goorangai was bound from Queenscliff to anchor at Portsea, while steaming outwards at full speed through the South Channel was the dark silhouette of the 10,400 ton outward bound passenger liner Duntroon bound from Melbourne to Sydney. The HMAS Goorangai was seen at the last minute by those on the bridge of the Duntroon, but it was too late to avert a collision. At 8.45pm the diminutive HMAS Goorangai had no chance as it was struck almost amidships by the huge bow of the fast moving liner and sank immediately. Rescue efforts were hampered as searchlights were forbidden and the Queenscliff lifeboat got stuck on a bank in attempting to attend the rescue. Lifejackets were thrown in the direction of cries of men by those on board the Duntroon but in the strong ebb tide no survivors were ever found and only six bodies recovered afterwards.</P>\r\n<P>The Court of Marine Inquiry initially blamed both vessels with Capt.Lloyd of the Duntroon found guilty of misconduct. However he was later exonerated by the Court with faulty positioning of lights on the Goorangai cited as the prime cause of the accident. A censorship ban was invoked by Naval Board until the next-of-kin wereinformed, setting a precedent for similar cases and for casualties in action. The ship wreck was reportedly demolished by explosives in January 1941 but still buoyed until March 1942, with its Registration Certificate recorded as cancelled on 2nd November 1942.</P>\r\n<P>Numerous calls were made over the years by relatives of the deceased servicemen to protect the wreck in 15 metres depth as a war grave and a national memorial. Items such as gas masks were known to have been found by divers, as well as distressing rumours that human bones and a skull had been removed from the site by divers in the 1970s and 1980s. However the Commonwealth Veterans Affairs Department and Australian Office for War Graves have no power to declare sunken vessels as war graves. There was no protection of the site until the Victorian Historic Shipwrecks Act (1981) was introduced. The HMAS Goorangai is now protected under the Victorian Heritage Act (1995) and it is an offence to disturb or remove any material from the site.</P>",

The gateway marks not only the First World War theatre of war but a friendship between Villers - Bretanneaux and Robinvale as sister towns, who were 'twinned' in 1984.</P>\r\n<P>Robinvale is named in memory of Lieutenant George Robin Cuttle, who was killed in action dring air combat over France in 1918. Cuttle was born in 1896, the second son of Hubert and Margaret Cuttle who had a general store (Cuttles Malle Stores) at Ultima near Swan Hill. His father made him manager of a large property at Euston across the Murray River from what is now Robinvale in 1914 when he was just 18.</P>\r\n<P>On the outbreak of the First World War, Cuttle, who was 203 centimetres and over 100 kilos, tried to enlist in the AIF but was rejected. Perhaps he was too big. But he was also very determined. He travelled to England and tried to enlist in the Royal flying Corps, but was again rejected as too heavy and tall for the flying machines. Instead he joined the Royal Field Artillery in July 1916 and served on the Somme, where he was awarded the Military Cross.</P>\r\n<P>In late 1917, conditions for entry to the RFC had changed, and Rbin joined as an observer. He was flying with 49 Squadron, flying DH9 bombers. Returning from a mission on 9 May 1918, the aircraft was shot down. The bodies were never found and Cuttle is remembered on the Arras Flying Memorial and the Ultima War Memorial.</P>\r\n<P>After the war, in 1923, Robin's parents and brother Robert went to France to search for him. At Caix, 10 kilometres from Villers-Bretonneux, they found evidence of the wreck.</P>\r\n<P>In 1924, the Cuttles were planning to develop the land they had acquired on the bend in the Murray once the railway reached there. The story goes that at the opening of the land sale at the new station, Robin's mother embroidered a piece of hessian with flowers and the words Robin Vale - (Farewell Robin) and so it came about. Another story is that the post office originally known as Bumbang was renamed Robinvale for the same reason. The Cuttles built a new home named Robinswood there.</P>",

These plantings, however, rarely consisted of more than two or three trees in each town.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>During and after the First World War avenues of honour consisting of trees lining significant streets became a popular form of commemoration. They represented a new egalitarian approach to the commemoration of soldiers where rank was not a consideration: each tree symbolises a person.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Avenues of honour are a uniquely Australian phenomenon. Australians, and in particular Victorians, embraced the idea of planting them more enthusiastically than any other country in the world. Dating from May 1916, the Eurack Avenue of Honour is the earliest known avenue of honour to be planted in Victoria. \r\n<P></P>By the time of the Second World War avenues of honour had declined in popularity as a means of commemoration. Today it is estimated that over 300 avenues of honour have been planted in Victoria to commemorate service personnel since 1901.</P>\r\n<P></P>",

Maygar enlisted in the Victorian Mounted Rifles in March 1891 and went with the 5th (Mounted Rifles) Contingent in March 1901. At Geelhoutboom, on 23 November 1901, Lieutenant Maygar was awarded the Victoria Cross for rescuing a fellow Victorian whose horse had been shot. With the enemy only 200 yards away, Maygar dismounted, put the man on his own horse, told him to gallop for the British lines, and ran back under heavy fire. His VC was presented by Lord Kitchener.</P>\r\n<P>Maygar enlisted in the AIF on 20 August 1914 and was appointed a captain in the 4th Light Horse Regiment, serving at Gallipoli and given command of the 8th LHR as lieutenant colonel. Maygar led his regiment througout its service in Sinai and Palestine until his death, and was a much-admired leader. During the second battle of Gaza, on 19 April 1917, official historian Sir Henry Gullett (1941) records that \"It was a day when true leaders recognised that their men needed inspiration, and Maygar gave it in the finest manner.\"</P>\r\n<P>Late on the day of the battle of Beersheba, 31 October 1917, a German aeroplane, using bombs and machine guns, hit Maygar, whose arm was shattered.

Without hesitation, Ingram, at the head of his platoon, rushed a post, captured nine machine guns and killed forty-two Germans who had shown stubborn resistance. Later, after his company had suffered severe casualties and many officers had fallen, he took control of the situation once again, rallied his men under intense fire, and led them forward. He rushed another fortification and overcame serious resistance. Twice more that day, he displayed great courage and leadership in the capture of enemy posts and the taking of sixty-two prisoners.</P>\r\n<P>Ingram was born near Bendigo and spent most of his childhood around Lilydale, where he went to the local state school, and then was apprenticed as a carpenter and joiner.</P>\r\n<P>From 1905 to 1914, Ingram was a member of the militia forces and was attached to the Australian Garrison Artillery. On 10 December 1914, he enlisted as a private in the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force, and served in New Guinea until his discharge on 19 January 1916. On the same day, he enlisted in the AIF and, a year later, was with the 24th Battalion in France. </P>\r\n<P>Ingramwas awarded the Military Medal \"for great courage and initiative as a member of the bombing section, by excellent placing of his bombs\" at Grevillers, near Bapaume, in March. He was in hospital from April until June, and again during September and October, after which he rejoined his battalion. Lieutenant Ingram was awarded the Victoria Cross for his part in the last Australian infantry action, the attack on Montbrehain on 5 October 1918.</P>\r\n<P>In April 1919, he returned to Melbourne and on his discharge became general foreman wit E.A. and Frank Watts Pty Ltd, building contractors. After the completion of the Shrine of Remembrance, he became a guard there. During the Second World War, he served with the Royal Australian Engineers and attained the rank of captain.</P>\r\n<P>Captain Ingram died at home in Hastings on 30 June 1961 and was buried in Frankston Cemetery.</P>",

The site replaces the former memorial on Fryers Street and now comprises of a large area paved with flagstones, a cross made of lawn and two sculptures of infantrymen (including the original memorial's 1924 sculpture) set against angular white walls. The white wall of the memorial is dedicated to fallen servicemen and those who fought in the Boer War, First World War, Second World War, Korea, Malaya, Borneo, Vietnam, East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan.</P>\r\n<P>The 1924 sculpture, <EM>Helping Hand </EM>by Web Gilbert, depicts Pte. John Raws reaching his hand down to help his brother Robert from the trenches at St. Quentin during the First World War. Both were killed in action at Pozieres. The second sculpture, Bela Angyal's 2000 sculpture <EM>Mateship</EM>, was inspired by the famous war photographer Damian Parer and his image of a temporarily wounded and blinded Pte. Wally Johnson being helped by Sgt. Gordon Ayre, of Shepparton, across the Francisco River in Papua New Guinea. </P>\r\n<P>Gordon Ayre, had joined the militia in 1938. He was he was called up for full-time duty in November 1941, aged 36. He transferred to the AIF in September 1942, and landed in New Guinea in March 1943. In May, the 58/59th was sent to take part in the offensive to capture Lae and Salamaua.</P>\r\n<P>On 30 June, the 58th/59th attacked Bobdubi Ridge, which was heavily defended by the Japanese. In hard fighting over two day days, the battalion managed to secure a position on the ridge. At the end of July, the Old Vickers position was captured and the way opened to Salamaua. The Australians captured Salamaua on 11 September and Lae fell on 16 September.</P>\r\n<P>Ayre was awarded an immediate Military Medal for his untiring and courageous work as a stretcher-bearer in the action on the bobdubi Ridge, at the Old Vickers and Coconuts positions in that month. In the citation, Sergeant Ayre is credited with saving the lives of three wounded comrades on 30 June when 'he unhesitatingly went forward under a hail of enemy fire' and remained with them until he was able to evacuate. The citation, in Ayre's service records, states that on 5 July he:</P>\r\n<P><EM>went forward with native carriers to locate a seriously wounded man. While evacuating him the party came under heavy fire from mortars and machine guns, and the carriers abandoned the stretcher. Sergeant Ayres displayed unflinching devotion to duty and outstanding paitence and courage and remained with the paitent until he was able to reassemble the carriers. He guided them back to safety under great difficulties, at one time moving breast deep 500 metres up the Francisco River. On 28 July he courageously managed the evacuation of a further 8 casualties under heavy shell fire.</EM></P>\r\n<P>The Francisco River was (and still is) a horrible malarial area, and Ayre contracted the first of a recurring series of bouts of malaria here. He served in New Guinea until July 1944, when, after periods in hospital, he was posted to the Murchison Prisoner of War Group in February 1945 - by now he was aged 43. His distinguished service ended when he was discharged in June 1947.</P>\r\n<P>The First World War panels list the eighty-three men of the district who lost their lives. They include Richard Nicholls, who worked in a grocer's shop in Shepparton, and who enlisted aged 16 on 12 June 1916 in the 2nd Pioneer Battalion. He transferred to the 46th Battalion in February 1918, and was a battalion runner.</P>\r\n<P>Private Nicholls was awarded the Military medal for gallantry as a runner on 6 April 1918 when he carried an important message over a kilometre of exposed ground before dawn, helping bring a wounded officer on the way. According to Red Cross records, he said 'my company commander will want me' and made his return journey in the daylight, crawling from shell hole to shell hole, exposed to snipers.</P>\r\n<P>On August 8 1918, Nicholls contributed to Germany's 'Black Day' for the action in which he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for exceptional bravery near Hamel. The citation records that during an attack he noticed a group of the enemy putting up a stiff fight in a gully, and, collecting a small party of men, led them across the gully to cut them off. Although the men with him were held up by the intense machine-gun fire, he kept on and succeeded with the help of an officer in taking several of the enemy prisoners. His daring and initiative were a fine example to his comrades. Ten days later he was mortally wounded by a shell at Lihons, and is now buried in the Villers-Bretonneux Military Cemetery. Nicholl's older brother, Ernest William Nicholls, enlisted in 1918 and served with the 58th Battalion, also serving in the Second World War.</P>",

    "name": "Traralgon Avenue of Honour",
    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Traralgon Avenue of Honour was planted on Kay Street in 1929 to commemorate the First World War. Kay Street was originally the main road leading into Traralgon from Melbourne and this accounted for its exceptional width, which is unusual within Traralgon. It was originally lined with pines that were planted in 1903. In 1911, there were already suggestions by members of theCouncil that an avenue of elms replace these trees. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>In 1921, several pines at the Franklin Street end were removed to allow the construction of a First World War memorial 'Digger' statue, which was finally unveiled on 25th February 1923. On 20th September 1928 The Traralgon Record heralded the fact that 'Pine trees in Kay Street gardens get the axe'. In October of that year, the gardens were ploughed and the new trees later planted. Photos indicate that a picket fence surrounded a large proportion of this plantation. Also at this time, the war memorial was landscaped in gravel and patterned grass sections. There are no longer any fences or park seats and the grassed area is continuous, replacing the paths of gravel.</P>\r\n<P>By 1929 all the pines had been replaced by Elm trees (<EM>Ulmus procera, Ulmus x hollandia</EM>) planted in a double row from Franklin to Breed streets. In 1979, the memorial statue was moved to face west, flanking wings were added and the names of the soldiers who died in the Second World War and Vietnam inscribed on the pedestal. As of 2011, the Elm trees have been pollarded and require extensive tree surgery to restructure the crown.</P>\r\n<P>In Australia, commemorative trees have been planted in public spaces since the late nineteenth century. Arbor Days were held regularly in most Victorian State Schools during the late 1800s and early 1900s, and numerous trees were planted in parks in Melbourne and throughout Victoria to mark the visits of important and famous people. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>This tradition of commemorative planting was continued in 1901 when at the end of the Boer War trees were often planted for each soldier of the district who was killed in South Africa. These plantings, however, rarely consisted of more than two or three trees in each town.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>During and after the First World War avenues of honour consisting of trees lining significant streets became a popular form of commemoration. They represented a new egalitarian approach to the commemoration of soldiers where rank was not a consideration: each tree symbolises a person.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Avenues of honour are a uniquely Australian phenomenon. Australians, and in particular Victorians, embraced the idea of planting them more enthusiastically than any other country in the world. Dating from May 1916, the Eurack Avenue of Honour is the earliest known avenue of honour to be planted in Victoria. \r\n<P></P>By the time of the Second World War avenues of honour had declined in popularity as a means of commemoration. Today it is estimated that over 300 avenues of honour have been planted in Victoria to commemorate service personnel since 1901.</P>",

Tubb obtained his merit certificate and left school to manage the farm; he later worked his own land. He served in the militia in various Victorian units from 1900 to 1913.</P>\r\n<P>Tubb joined the AIF on 24 August 1914 in the 7th Battalion and landed at Gallipoli on 6 July 1915. On 8 August, Captain Tubb took over a vital sector of captured trench at Lone Pine, with orders to hold it at any cost. Early on the 9th, the Turks launched a furious attack, advancing along a sap which had been barricaded with sandbags. From the parapet, with eight men, Tubb fired at the enemy; two corporals in the trench caught enemy bombs and threw them back or smothered them with greatcoats. Although Tubb was blown from the parapet and the barricade was repeatedly wrecked, each time it was rebuilt. He inspired his men, joking and shouting encouragement.</P>\r\n<P>A huge explosion blew in the barricade and killed or wounded most of the defenders. Wounded in the arm and scalp, Tubb was left with Corporals Alexander Burton and William Dunstan; he led them into action, shooting three Turks with his revolver and providing covering fire while the barricade was rebuilt. A bomb burst, killing Burton and temporarily blinding Dunstan. Tubb then obtained additional help, but the Turks did not renew the attack.</P>\r\n<P>Evacuated that evening, Tubb was taken to England to convalesce and was awarded the Victoria Cross. After an emergency appendectomy he was invalided to Australia, arrivingin April 1916. He persuaded a medical board that he was fit, and rejoined his battalion in France in December. His company had an important role in the Menin Road attack, 3rd battle of Ypres, on 20 September 1917. Tubb was hit by a sniper and while being taken out on a stretcher, he was mortally wounded by shell-fire. Tubb was buried in the Lijessenthoek military cemetery.</P>\r\n<P>Three of his brothers also served and returned to Australia: Lieutenant Arthur Oswald Tubb, 60th Battalion; Captain Frank Reid Tubb MC, 7th Battalion; and Sapper Alfred Charles Tubb, Anzac Signal Squadron.</P>",

The plaque lists the names of those fifteeen men as well as those who served in the Second World War. Originally the Avenue was planted with thirty-one Moreton Bay Figs, Pines and Eucalypts trees but only nine trees remain.</P>\r\n<P>In Australia, commemorative trees have been planted in public spaces since the late nineteenth century. Arbor Days were held regularly in most Victorian State Schools during the late 1800s and early 1900s, and numerous trees were planted in parks in Melbourne and throughout Victoria to mark the visits of important and famous people. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>This tradition of commemorative planting was continued in 1901 when at the end of the Boer War trees were often planted for each soldier of the district who was killed in South Africa. These plantings, however, rarely consisted of more than two or three trees in each town.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>During and after the First World War avenues of honour consisting of trees lining significant streets became a popular form of commemoration. They represented a new egalitarian approach to the commemoration of soldiers where rank was not a consideration: each tree symbolises a person.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Avenues of honour are a uniquely Australian phenomenon. Australians, and in particular Victorians, embraced the idea of planting them more enthusiastically than any other country in the world. Dating from May 1916, the Eurack Avenue of Honour is the earliest known avenue of honour to be planted in Victoria. \r\n<P></P>By the time of the Second World War avenues of honour had declined in popularity as a means of commemoration. Today it is estimated that over 300 avenues of honour have been planted in Victoria to commemorate service personnel since 1901.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Returned and Services League (RSL) was founded in 1916 to support serving and ex-service Defence Force members and their families. The first RSL headquarters were established in Melbourne; however, by the mid 1920s RSL branches were quickly established throughout Australia. By way of comparison, the Castlemaine RSL had already approached the Council about obtaining a grant of land for the construction of a hall in 1918. The RSL hall at 293-303 High Street was constructed as a war memorial to the Soldiers of Prahran. It was designed by Haddon &amp; Henderson architects and constructed by W. Machin at a cost of £3,500. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The foundation stone of the building was laid on 25 August 1920. A report by the Mayor, records the event: </P>\r\n<P><I>I had the honor of performing the ceremony of laying the foundation stone of the clubrooms which are to be erected for the use of returned soldiers on the 25th August in the presence of a large number of people. On its completion, the new building will. be handed over to the Prahran Branch of the Returned Soldiers' League unencumbered.. The new building is to occupy at the present fifty feet of the High Street frontage and will be of monumental classic design, two stories in height. The accommodation comprises a spacious entrance hall, leading to a large open club lounge and reading room, occupying one side of the site. On the other side are president's committee, and secretary's room and lavatory accommodation. The upper floor is approached by a spacious stairway from the north east corner, which leads into a fine general room to be fitted by the club with four billiard tables and other conveniences, as also a buffet. The design makes provisions for future extensions in the shape of an assembly hall at the rear of the present structure, such hall to include stage, dressing rooms and other accessories. </I></P>\r\n<P><I></I></P>\r\n<P>In fact, the final cost of the building (not including the architect's fees) was £3,942/8/5. Notice of the hall's completion, was sent to T. Romanins Esq (Town Clerk) on 17 June 1921. The original plans for the building were given to the Mayor (which may explain their absence from the Council's collection). Despite the RSL taking over responsibility for the building, Council retained ownership of the land, renting it out on a quarterly basis for the \"rent of one peppercorn if demanded\". The Council attached a number of conditions to the lease, including that the members of the RSL not fall below 25, that the hall only be used by the RSL, that no disorderly or offensive conduct take place or any party political meetings or meetings of a sectarian nature take place. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>In 1926 an assembly hall was added to the structure (along the lines of that initially outlined in the Mayor's speech). There have been some alterations to the building since. Of note is the addition of a stage banner, featuring the words \"We will remember them\" measuring 5.5m x 4.3m that was painted by R. W. Bridges in 1949. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>It is a two-storey building with a rendered facade in the Beaux Arts style, articulated by four rusticated pilasters. One is at either corner and terminates in a rendered globe above the cornice. The central two pilasters define the entry and their tops flank a segmented arched pediment which shows influence of the Arts &amp; Crafts style. The pediment conceals a gabled roof clad in corrugated metal.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Inside, the entire west wall of the entrance hall is covered by an attractive Blackwood honour board. There is a doorway set into the middle of it, above which are two carved wreaths. The double doors are of matching varnished timber and have nine lights each at the top. Other doors in the entrance hall appear to have been replaced with standard four-panel doors.</P>\r\n<P>Architect Robert Haddon was born in London in 1866 and emigrated to Melbourne in 1899. He established his own practice in 1901. William Henderson joined the practice in 1903 and in 1919 became a partner. Haddon was known as an innovative architect who's style can be considered within the context of the Art Nouveau movement. His architectural ideas are well communicated in his text <I>Australian Architecture</I>, which was published in 1908. He died in 1929.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Talbot Soldier's Memorial Park, on Heales Street, contains memorials dedicated to the Boer War (1899-1902), First World War (1914-18) and Second World War (1939-45). The park is one manifestation of the numerous forms of soldier's memorials which appeared in Australia following participation in wars. Avenues of honour or memorials were the main responses and the idea of a park as a memorial was not commonly adopted. However, in common with avenues of honour the park uses trees as a symbol of new life and growth. The park also forms an appropriately landscaped buffer between Camp Street and Heales Street and the more recent development in Landsdowne Street.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Originally the park was set aside as a market reserve. Thomas Couchman, the acting District Surveyor favoured a six and half acre site south of the present Presbyterian Church for the market but the council still pressed for the preferred site in Heales Street. This finally received support from Clement Hodgkinson, Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Survey who recommended the reservation of 2 acres 3 roods 16 perches on 29 April 1862. On 30th November 1866, the council moved that suitable buildings and yards be erected on the market reserve as soon as possible to enable the conduct of a weekly market of animals and produce, although these plans were shelved in June 1868. The construction of the Fire Brigade Engine House (q.v.) in 1873 encroached on the site and a year later the council gave A. Campbell permission to erect a blacksmith's shop on the market reserve. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>In 1881 the council decided to install a pitched drain through the reserve along the watercourse which led from Ballaarat Street to Back Creek. After the cessation of hostilities in the First World War, the idea of converting the old market reserve into a memorial park with an avenue of honour was raised. A local committee was formed and at a public meeting on 7 May 1919, the idea was adopted:<BR><BR>\"<EM>It is expected that the cost of the planting of each tree will be about lOs 6d, and if you are desirous of donating a tree in memory of a soldier, or of joining with others in doing so, donations will be thankfully received by any of the officers. As time is limited for planting, we would be obliged by a reply for our next meeting on 4th June</EM>.\"</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>A.R. Outtrim M.P. officiated at the opening in mid 1919 and by April 1920 the Crown Lands and Survey Officer commented '<EM>[the site] has recently been enclosed with a substantial fence and avenues of trees planted ... with ornamental trees at a cost of 130 pounds as a memorial to soldiers of the district</EM>'. The market reservation was revoked by the state government on 13th July 1920 and the site re-reserved as a 'public park' in 1923. Regulations were gazetted in May 1924 which prohibited unauthorised musical performances, public betting, sport, lighting fires and spitting amongst other strictures. At this time the secretary of the committee of management wrote to the Secretary for Lands. 'There are no buildings at present on the reserve but it has been suggested that a small kiosk or summer house might be constructed some day when funds are available.' However, this wish did not apparently come to fruition.</P>\r\n<P>This park comprises two distinct sections. The first, a small enclosure on Heales Street, is uses as a picnic area and has concrete seats and tables. The second and far larger component comprises gently sloping ground with paved watercourse (presumably the one installed in 1881) and a fine collection of trees.</P>",

A map of the lands in the Eynesbury Woodhouse Pastoral Company estate, supplied by John Todd, shows the bombing range, 180 acres located west of the Werribee River and east of Mt. Mary Road. The quadrant huts associated with the range were located at three points: opposite Cobbledicks' Ford Road in Crown Allotment A, Section XX, Parish of Werribee; at the end of Mount Mary Road in Crown Allotment B, Section XXIV, Parish of Werribee; and in Crown Allotment A, Section XXIV, Parish of Werribee.

These quarters were constructed of timber and measured about 4 x 9 metres. In the years around 1942-43, RAAF planes flew over and dropped practice bombs on the site. The bombs were about 500mm long and released chemical smoke when they struck the ground so they could be easily seen. It is believed that one USAF plane mistook this bombing range for a gunnery range at where more powerful ammunition was used, and dropped a powerful bomb on the bombing range that caused damage to this site and surrounding buildings.2</P>",

    "name": "Corryong Avenue of Honour",
    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Corryong Avenue of Honour was one of several established in the eastern part of the shire during the later part of the First World War. In May 1918, the notion of planting an avenue in honour to commemorate the young men who served in the First World War was discussed at a public meeting; it was decided to start with a hundred trees and plant others year by year. A committee was established for the project, headed by W B Hamilton with A R Lacey as secretary.</P>\r\n<P>On 10th June 1918, a public meeting decided that 60 conifers (Cedrus Deodora) be planted starting at the hall on the 3-chain road, with four redwoods planted in the gully near Playle's and 40 deciduous trees Tillas (Lindens) be planted at the west end of the town. It was also decided to plant Currajong trees to fill the gaps in the street and to continue the double rows of trees as far as the doctors'.</P>\r\n<P>Subsequently contributions were procured from Corryong as well as surrounding districts including Colac Colac, Nariel and Khancoban, raising £25 for the trees, timber and fencing. The work of the planting and erecting of the timber guards was undertaken by 'a willing band of workers' on 29th August 1918, with a ceremony held in front of the Corryong Primary School. The first part of the proceedings was the unfurling of a new school flag. From there, the crowd moved to a point nearby on the Towong Road across which a red, white and blue ribbon had been stretched and a tree was yet to be planted. Mrs A. L. Hamilton senior, who was the eldest citizen in the area, planted the last tree and cut the ribbon, declaring the Avenue of Honour open for traffic. Mrs Hamilton was presented with the scissors used for the occasion and people were forced to retire to the Athenaeum Hall (later replaced with the existing Corryong Memorial Hall) because of heavy rain. Speeches were subsequently given by Mr Hamilton, Mr Beadmore (MLA for Benambra), Cr Nankervis, Cr P McMeekin, Lt Aspinall (a returned Anzac), Sgt Hiller (another Anzac), Cr Cronin, Mr G Jephcott, and Mr Acocks.</P>\r\n<P>It has not been determined how many trees were initially planted, however additional planting has been undertaken as many of the specimens further to the east are smaller. The gaps suggest that some trees may have been removed over the years.</P>\r\n<P>During the 1950s, the remaining Kurrajongs (Genus <I>Brachychiton</I>) were removed from the commercial zone Hansen Street (some had died over the years) in order to allow for the strengthening of the road to accommodate the large vehicles used to transport the pipes for the Snowy Mountains Scheme. In 1964, a contemporary newspaper article suggested that the avenue was not being well maintained and appropriately acknowledged by the local community. </P>\r\n<P>During the mid-1990s, Manchurian Pears were introduced into the commercial zone of Hansen Street. Recently, the large specimen in front of the Commonwealth Bank on the corner of Donaldson Street was cut down as its roots were affecting various pipes however a stump has been retained.</P>\r\n<P>The most substantial remnants of the avenue consists of some forty Indian Cedars (<I>Cedrus deodara</I>), which are native to the western Himalayas. It has however been suggested that some of the trees are Cedars of Lebanon (<I>Cedrus libani</I>). Up to four of the trees near the hotel may be redwoods as was originally proposed.</P>\r\n<P>The avenue extends along Towong Road about 0.75 kilometres from Donaldson Street (to no. 74, Pinnibar Motel on the north side and no. 71 on the south side). It seems as though the avenue was planted in stages and the most mature trees are to be found at the western end; essentially in front of the Corryong Primary School, between Donaldson Street and north of Anzac Avenue. </P>\r\n<P>The trees for the most part are located on a grassy island either side of the main carriageway with flanking service lanes. The topography is gently undulating with the highest point being the cutting opposite the Corryong Primary School, which has a canted stone retaining wall. </P>\r\n<P>North of the older section, the planting is less mature and less continuous with some substantial gaps in the planting and some deciduous species present. </P>\r\n<P>Further west of the commercial centre, the three Linden trees (genus <I>Tili</I>a, possibly the American species), on the roadway near the Masonic Temple in Hansen Street between McKay and Kiell Streets, are probably part of the original extent of the avenue. There are also three well-established trees to the roadway opposite which may be a related planting.</P>\r\n<P>In Australia, commemorative trees have been planted in public spaces since the late nineteenth century.

He produced several sculptures for the Australian War Memorial, such as <EM>Bomb Thrower</EM> and <EM>Stretcher-bearers. </EM>In 1923, <EM></EM>Gilbert resigned from his position as head sculptor to pursue other commissions for memorials. His memorials include one of a soldier aiding a wounded comrade, which was made originally for the British Medical Association in East Melbourne. It now stands outside the Australian Medical Association office at 293 Royal Parade, Parkville, and lists the doctors who enlisted in the First World War.</P>\r\n<P>Gilbert was born at Cockatoo near Maryborough moving to Melbourne aged 9, heworked in a cafe and then as a cook at Parer's Hotel. He attended the National Gallery of Victoria drawing school in 1888, but was a self-taught sculptor, beginning working in marble and then evenutally in bronze. He set up a studio and foundry at 59 Gore Street, Fitzroy, in 1908.</P>\r\n<P>In 1914, aged 47, Gilbert planned to travel to Paris, but when war broke out he went instead to London, where he spent some time working in a munitions factory. It was here that he met fellow sculptor Wallace Anderson. Lieutenant Anderson, from Geelong, had served in France with 23rd Battalion before posted to the Australian War Records Section as a Museums Officer. Anderson convinced Gilbert to join the Australian War Records Section as a sculptor, which he did in December 1918. Gilbert, Anderson and Leslie Bowles travelled through France making studies and models of battlefields and signficant sites to inform the design and construction of the dioramas they were to later make for the Australian War Memorial.</P>\r\n<P>Gilbert returned to Australia in 1920 and completed the 2nd Division monument, which was afterwards unveiled at Mont St. Quentin in the presence of Marshal Ferdinand Foch, who had been the supreme commander of the Allied armies during the war. Depicting a digger bayoneting a German in the Second World War.</P>\r\n<P>Gilbert's other works include <EM>Helping Hand </EM>at the Shepparton War Memorial, and <EM>Over the Top, </EM>which stands behind A Block at Victoria Barracks, and appears to be the sculpture that stood outside the offices of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures. He also made the Matthew Flinders sculpture outside St Paul's Cathedral and his larger-than-life sculpture Bomber is the stunning memorial at Broken Hill.</P>\r\n<P>Gilbert died in 1925 at the age of 57 from heart problems exacerbated by his physically demanding life - he used to make his own clay moulds- the middle of constructing a major memorial sculpture to the Desert Mounted Corps. In 1923, he had won a competition to design the memorial in remembrance of Australian and New Zealand soldiers who fought at Port Said in Egypt from 1916 to 1918. After his death, several other sculptors, including Paul Montford and Bertram Mackennal, completed the memorial. It was destroyed in the 1950s, but its power may be seen in the similar sculpture at Albany in Western Australia.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2><P>The Rupert Vance Moon Memorial Garden, on Williams Road, was unveiled at Mt Duneed Cemetery on 12 May 2008 by members of 5th/6th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment. The garden is named after Lieutenant Rupert Moon of the 58th Battalion who won a Victoria Cross in the closing stages of the battle at Bullecourt during the First World War, France 1917.</P>\r\n<P>On 12 May, the 58th were sent to clear three German positions - a large dug out, a concrete machine-gun post, and another trench. After a horrendous night of bombardment from the Germans, Moon's platoon set off fo the machine-gun emplacement, and Moon suffered his first wound. They took this position after Moon rallied his men, saying, 'Come on, boys, don't turn me down\" (Bean 1941). By the time the position was secure, Moon had been wounded four times in the four stages of the advance - the face, the shoulder, the foot and leg, and, finally, with a mutilating wound to the jaw. His leadership and courage had been decisive.</P>\r\n<P>Bullecourt was the site of two costly battles for the Australians, the first beginning in the bitterly cold dawn of 11 April 1917, when, after a night lying in the snow, the Australians were ordered to attack the main German defensive position, the Hindenburg Line. They were supposed to be backed up byBritish tanks and artillery, but neither of these eventuated, and when the Australians advanced, they were cut off by German artillery and machine guns. After ten hours, a withdrawal was ordered, and the surviving Australians had to fight their way back to their original positions. The 4th Brigade suffered 2339 casualties from 3000 men sent into battle; the 12th Brigade, 950 from 2000. The battle was later used by the British staff as a model of failed planning.</P>\r\n<P>At the first battle of Bullecourt, Albert Jacka added a Bar to the MC he won at Pozieres. In a night reconnaissance before the battle, he brought in a German patrol who had seen him lay the start-line for the attack, and achieved this without his pistol, which had failed. Jacka's actions saved the Australians from discovery and bombardment.</P>\r\n<P>The second battle at Bullecourt, from 3 to 17 May, was somewhat better planned. The 2nd Division was to take the German positions in the village of Bullecourt, and they succeeded, using 96 Vickers machine guns instead of the unreliable tanks. But even with better planning, the attack cost the four Australian divisions another 10 000 casualties.</P>\r\n<P>Rupert Vance 'Mick' Moon (1892-1986) was born at Bacchus Marsh, Victoria. He spent his childhood years at Maffra in Gippsland, Victoria. He attended Kyneton Grammar School. When he finished school, Moon began working for the National Bank in Melbourne, where is father, Arthur, worked as an inspector. Before the First World War, Moon had been a member of the 13th Light Horse and 8th Infantry Regiments. He enlisted as a trumpeter in the 4th Light Horse Regiment on 21 August 1914. He embarked for Alexandria on 15 May 1915 and served at Gallipoli. Moon was commissioned as a second lieutenant in September 1916 and was posted to the 58th Battalion.</P>\r\n<P>After his magnificent bravery at Bullecourt in May, and having recovered from his wounds, Moon was invested with the Victoria Cross at Buckingham Palace by King George V in August 1917. He briefly returned to Australia in March in 1918, and then in May that year returned to Europe. On 5 Feburary 1919, he was promoted to temporary captain. Moon returned to Australia in June, with his AIF appointment ending on 4 October that year, as an honorary captain. He resumed his work at the bank, but left a few years later to work for wool brokers in Geelong.</P>\r\n<P>Captain Moon also served in the Second World War. He was rejected for the AIF in 1940 because of his physical fitness, but joined the 6th Victorian Battalion of the Home Guard, the RSL Volunteer Defence Corps in 1942. His medical records tells the tale. He answered yes to questions about whether he had suffered neurasthenia or nervous breakdown, dysentery, malaria, broken bones, gun shot wounds, shell shock and gas poisoning. Nowhere on the form does Moon say that the surgery (repair to jaws 1917, removal of pieces of bone from tongue 1920) was the result of his VC action.</P>\r\n<P>He married Susan Vincent on 18 December 1931 and had one son and a daughter. He lived for many years at Calder Park, Mt Duneed, and died at Barwon Heads in 1986, aged 94.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>Inside the All Nations Park on Separation Street, is a memorial sculpture dedicated to the life of Corporal Rodney Breavington. Breavington attempted escape in a small fishing boat from the Japanese Prisoner of War Camp,Changi in Singapore. However he was caught along with Private Victor Lawrence Gale. Both were made to dig their own graves, tortured and then executed on Changi beach by a firing squad. </P>\r\n<P>Rodney Breavington was a 38-year-old policeman from Fairfield, born in Southend, England. He enlisted on 8 December 1941 and was a motor transport fitter with the Australian Army Ordnance Corps. He was posted to the 8th Division in Singapore, landing on 26 January 1942, barely three weeks before the surrender to the Japanese.</P>\r\n<P>With Private Victor Lawrence Gale, a 23-year-old fitter and turner from Balwyn, Breavington escaped from Singapore in May 1942 by stealing a fishing boat and attempting to sail to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). After an epic voyage of nearly 2000 kilometres, and near their destination, they were picked up by a Japanese warship and returned to Changi in July. Desperately ill, and barely able to walk, Breavington was confined to Hospital.</P>\r\n<P>What became known as the Selarang Barracks Square incident occurred on 30 August 1942, when some 15,000 prisoners, nearly all Australian, were concentrated into a small area of one of the old barracks at Changi by the Japanese for several days and nights with little water, food or sanitation.</P>\r\n<P>The Japanese demanded that each Australian sign a document promising not to escape; this was against what the men saw as their duty. During this stand-off, on 2 September 1942, Breavington, Gale and two British prisoners were made to walk from Changi to a beach. Breavington was still in hospital pyjamas. After some hours they were made to dig their own graves in front of the assembled witnesses, including the Australian commander at Changi, Lieutenant Colonel Fredrick 'Black Jack' Galleghan.</P>\r\n<P>Breavington pleaded for the life of Gale, saying that he had ordered him to escape. This was refused by the Japanese in charge of the firing squad, a Lieutenant Okusaki. The firing squad was composed of Sikh soldiers, formerly in the British Army, who had changed sides in the treacherous pursuit of Indian Independence promised by Japan.</P>\r\n<P>After cigarettes, prayers, refusing a blindfold and holding a picture of his wife, Breavington and the others were shot. They were intentionally only wounded - tortured- and it took many bullets before Breavington called out \"For God's sake, shoot me through the head and kill me.\" Galleghan said Breavington was the bravest the man he had ever seen (RAAOC Association 2006).</P>\r\n<P>The Australians back at Selarang were then advised to sign returned to their original barracks. Many were afterwards sent to work as slave labour on the Thai-Burma Railway.</P>\r\n<P>Breavington's action inspired a poem, the 'Corporal and his Pal' by one of the witnesses to the executions:</P>\r\n<P><EM>Example, yes- of how to die,</EM></P>\r\n<P><EM>And how to meet one's fate.</EM></P>\r\n<P><EM>Example, true - of selfless love</EM></P>\r\n<P><EM>A man has for his mate.</EM></P>\r\n<P>We share the killing ground at Changi beach with some of the 50,000 Chinese Singaporeans killed in the Sook Ching massacres.</P>\r\n<P>Corporal Breavington was awarded a posthumous Mention in Despatches after the war for 'services rendered whilst POW in Japanese hands.' He and Private Gale are buried at Kranji War Cemetery in Singapore.</P>",

    "description": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The Royal Exhibition Building (REB), situated in Carlton Gardens, was designed in 1878 by Melbourne architect Joseph Reed for the Melbourne International Exhibition (MIE) of 1880-81. Thirty-three nations responded to the invitation to participate in the MIE, and over 32000 exhibits were displayed from every corner of the world. Almost forty nations were represented at the Melbourne Centennial International Exhibition (MCIE) of 1888-89.During the six months the MCIE was open it attracted almost two million visitors, double the population of Victoria at that time. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>In May 1901, the building hosted the opening of the first Australian Federal Parliament. A few months later the Australian flag was first unveiled and flown above the dome. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>On 4 February 1919, the REB was turned into a hospital to treat Melburnians struck down by the Spanish 'flu'. Initially housing 500 beds, the hospital grew to accommodate 2000 patients. In a six month period, 4, 046 patients were treated at the REB hospital, of whom 392 died. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The Australian War Museum (which became the Australian War Memorial in 1923) opened in the eastern annexe of the REB on 20 August 1921. The first exhibition of photographs ran for five weeks and attracted over 80,000 visitors. A second exhibition of objects of war and dioramas of battle scenes (now in the AWM collection in Canberra) opened on Anzac Day 1922. Over 800,000 visited the Australian War Memorial before its relocation to Sydney in January 1925. </P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>Between March 1941 and December 1945, the RAAF No. 1 School of Technical Training occupied the Exhibition Building. Two thousand personnel were camped on the floors of the great hall; a shower block was set up in the vestibule behind the organ; the concert hall in the western nave was transformed into a recreation room; and a kitchen, hospital, laundry block and store-room was built on the arena to the north of the building.</P>\r\n<P></P>\r\n<P>The annexes built during the RAAF occupation of the REB site became a migrant reception centre in 1949. The centre provided temporary accommodation for thousands of recent arrivals from Britain, who remember the bungalows as being freezing cold in winter and stifling hot in summer. At its close in 1961-62, the centre comprised 29 bungalows over 1.4 hectares.</P>\r\n<P></P>Since 1880, the REB and Carlton Gardens have hosted bazaars, exhibitions, commercial events, trade shows, international meetings and community events. They continue to be used in this way today, and this was a principle reason for the Royal Exhibition Building and Carlton Gardens receiving World Heritage Listing in 2004. ",

Hec Waller (4 April 1900 - 1 March 1942) was a senior officer in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). In a career spanning almost thirty years, he served in both world wars. At the helm of HMAS Stuart in the Mediterranean from 1939 to 1941, he won recognition as a skilful ship's captain and flotilla commander. He then transferred to the South West Pacific as captain of the light cruiser HMAS Perth, and went down with his ship against heavy odds during the Battle of Sunda Strait in early 1942.</P>\r\n<P>Born in Benalla, Victoria, Waller entered the Royal Australian Naval College at the age of thirteen. After graduating, he served with the Royal Navy (RN) in the closing stages of World War I. Between the wars, he specialised in communications and was posted as signals officer to various British and Australian warships. He gained his first sea-going command in 1937, as captain of HMS Brazen. In September 1939, he took charge of HMAS Stuart and four other obsolete destroyers that together became known as the \"Scrap Iron Flotilla\". In 1940, these were augmented by other ships to form the 10th Destroyer Flotilla, supporting Allied troops in North Africa.</P>\r\n<P>Waller was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and Bar, and twice mentioned in despatches, for his achievements in the Mediterranean. He assumed command of HMAS Perth in October 1941, taking part in the Battle of the Java Sea shortly before his final action in Sunda Strait. He received a third mention in despatches posthumously, and in 2011 came under formal consideration for the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) for his performance as Perth's captain. The submarine HMAS Waller is named in his honour.</P>\r\n<P></P>",
